# 06 - API Specification

## 6.1 API Overview

### Base URL

Every REST route is mounted under the global `api` prefix:

```
http://<host>:2785/api
```

For local development that is `http://localhost:2785/api`; behind a reverse proxy substitute your public origin (the `/api` prefix is unchanged).

### Authentication

A global API-key guard protects every route unless it is explicitly marked **public** (`@Public()`). Send the key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```http
X-API-Key: owa_k1_your-api-key-here
```

> **Auth is header-only (never in a URL).** A query-parameter API key is **not** accepted anywhere. REST routes take the key via the `X-API-Key` header; the WebSocket (Socket.IO) handshake — see §6.5 Real-time API — accepts it via the handshake `auth.apiKey` field or the `X-API-Key` header. The former `?apiKey=` query fallback was **removed** (it leaked the credential into proxy/access logs). Never put the key in a URL.

The metrics endpoint is the lone exception to the API-key scheme: it authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer <METRICS_TOKEN>` instead of `X-API-Key`.

### Common Headers

```http
X-API-Key: owa_k1_your-api-key      # required on every non-public REST route
Content-Type: application/json       # required on requests with a JSON body
```

`Content-Type: application/json` is only needed when sending a body. There is no required `Accept` or `X-Request-ID` header.

### Roles & Authorization

API keys carry one of three roles, ordered by privilege:

| Role       | Rank | Can do                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `viewer`   | 1    | Read-only routes (no `@RequireRole`, or routes that only need a valid key)                                                           |
| `operator` | 2    | Everything a viewer can, plus write/action routes guarded by `@RequireRole(OPERATOR)` (send messages, group/contact mutations, etc.) |
| `admin`    | 3    | Everything, plus admin-only routes guarded by `@RequireRole(ADMIN)` (API-key management, settings)                                   |

`@RequireRole(role)` enforces a **minimum** role using the hierarchy `VIEWER < OPERATOR < ADMIN`: a key satisfies the guard if its own rank is ≥ the required rank (so an `admin` key passes an `OPERATOR`-guarded route). A route with no `@RequireRole` accepts any valid key, including `viewer`. A key whose role is below the requirement gets `403 Forbidden`; a missing or invalid key gets `401 Unauthorized`.

A key may additionally be scoped to specific sessions (`allowedSessions`) and/or source IPs (`allowedIps`). The scope/IP check runs in the guard **before** any role check, so a request outside that scope is rejected with `401` (not `403`) even if the role would otherwise allow it.

### API-Key Lifecycle

OpenWA seeds an initial admin key on first run (printed to the startup log and written to `data/.api-key`, or `/app/data/.api-key` in Docker). Use it to mint scoped, lower-privilege keys for integrations. Full key creation, listing, rotation, and revocation are documented under the auth resource in **§6.4.9 (API Keys)**.

## 6.2 Response Format

> **OpenWA returns the raw handler payload directly — there is NO `{ success, data, meta }` envelope.** A resource route returns the resource object as-is; a list route returns a **bare JSON array**. Read fields directly (`response.id`, not `response.data.id`).

### Success Response

A successful request returns the resource (or array) exactly as the handler produced it:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "my-session",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

List endpoints return a bare array (some paginated list routes instead return a small wrapper such as `{ "messages": [...], "total": 42 }` — the per-endpoint docs state the exact shape):

```json
[
  { "id": "…", "name": "session-a" },
  { "id": "…", "name": "session-b" }
]
```

Session `status` wire values are **lowercase**: `created | initializing | qr_ready | authenticating | ready | disconnected | action_required | failed`.

### Error Response

Errors use the NestJS default shape. The HTTP status is on the status line and mirrored in `statusCode`; there is no application-specific `code` field:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Session 'my-session' not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}
```

Validation failures (`statusCode: 400`) return `message` as an **array** of field-level strings. A global `ValidationPipe` runs with `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`, so any request-body field not declared on the DTO is rejected with `400`.

### General Error Codes

| HTTP Status | Meaning               | When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Timestamp Conventions

OpenWA uses **two** timestamp representations — be careful which a field is:

- **Message timestamps are epoch numbers (Unix seconds), not ISO strings.** This applies to the `timestamp` field on messages returned by send responses, history, and persisted message records (the persisted column is stored as a bigint and surfaced as a `number`).
- **Entity audit fields use ISO-8601 UTC strings** (example: `2026-02-02T10:00:00.000Z`). This applies to `createdAt` / `updatedAt` on persisted entities, `expiresAt`, batch `startedAt` / `completedAt`, and similar metadata fields.

## 6.3 Media Specifications

### Media DTO (flat shape)

All media send routes (`send-image`, `send-video`, `send-audio`, `send-document`, `send-sticker`) share one **flat** request DTO — `SendMediaMessageDto`. There is **no** nested `{ image: { url } }` wrapper; the media source fields sit at the top level of the body:

| Field      | Type     | Required    | Constraints                                         | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chatId`   | string   | yes         | non-empty                                           | Recipient — `<phone>@c.us` or `<groupId>@g.us`                                                   |
| `url`      | string   | conditional | valid http/https URL; required when `base64` absent | Remote media URL. Fetched server-side through an SSRF guard; a blocked/internal URL yields `400` |
| `base64`   | string   | conditional | required when `url` absent                          | Raw base64 media data. Decoded size is checked against the media cap                             |
| `mimetype` | string   | conditional | required when `base64` is used                      | MIME type, e.g. `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`, `application/pdf`                                     |
| `filename` | string   | no          | max 255 chars                                       | Optional file name (also used as the persisted body fallback for documents)                      |
| `caption`  | string   | no          | max 1024 chars                                      | Optional caption (not persisted for audio)                                                       |
| `mentions` | string[] | no          | array of WIDs                                       | WIDs to @mention in the caption (e.g. `["62811@c.us"]`). See **Mentions** below                  |

Provide **exactly one** of `url` or `base64`. Omitting both, or supplying `base64` without `mimetype`, returns `400`.

A document sent without a `filename` is delivered under the default name `file` — on the whatsapp-web.js engine, a URL-based send first derives the URL basename before that fallback applies.

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "caption": "Check out this image!"
}
```

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
  "filename": "photo.jpg"
}
```

### Size Limit

There is a **single shared media byte cap**, not a per-type table. A base64 (or downloaded) media blob whose **decoded** size exceeds the cap is rejected with `413 Payload Too Large`. The cap is `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, default **50 MiB (52,428,800 bytes)**; the same value bounds outbound base64 sends, remote-URL downloads, and inbound media. It takes a raw byte count, not a unit string, and the gateway refuses to boot on a non-positive or non-numeric value rather than falling back silently (`50mb` would parse to 50 bytes).

### Text Limit

`send-text` enforces a maximum body length of **4096 characters** (`text` is `@MaxLength(4096)`). Media captions are limited to **1024 characters**.

### Mentions

`send-text`, the media send routes, `send-template`, `send-bulk` (per item), `reply` and `edit` all accept an optional `mentions` array of WIDs (`<phone>@c.us`) to tag participants — most useful in groups. On `edit` the tags are re-applied rather than preserved: an edit replaces the message content, so a rewritten body that still reads `@62811` loses the tag unless the list is sent again. Two things are required for WhatsApp to render a tag and notify the participant:

1. The `mentions` array lists the WID(s), e.g. `["62811@c.us"]`.
2. The `text`/`caption` contains the matching `@<number>` token, e.g. `Hello @62811`.

The contract is engine-neutral: pass neutral `@c.us` WIDs and the active engine (whatsapp-web.js or Baileys) de-normalizes them internally. Whether a mention surfaces a notification is ultimately client-side — outside a shared group some clients may not render it.

### Send response: `201` means accepted, not delivered

Single-recipient send routes under `/messages` return **HTTP 201** with `{ "messageId", "timestamp" }` as soon as the gateway hands the message to the WhatsApp client. This confirms the send was _accepted_ — it does **not** confirm the recipient received it. Two routes differ: `POST send-bulk` returns **202** with a batch envelope (`{ batchId, status, totalMessages, … }`), and the `status/send-*` routes return **201** with `{ statusId, timestamp, expiresAt }` — a `statusId`, not a `messageId`, and an ISO timestamp rather than epoch seconds.

Two consequences worth knowing:

1. **WhatsApp does not reject an unregistered recipient synchronously.** A message to a number that is not on WhatsApp still returns `201` with a valid `messageId`. Whether it later delivers, stalls, or is reported as an error reaches you asynchronously, if at all.
2. **There is no synchronous delivery confirmation on either engine** (whatsapp-web.js or Baileys), so the `201` cannot be made to mean "delivered."

**Before sending to a new number**, you can confirm it is a registered WhatsApp account with `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/check/:number` (returns `{ exists, whatsappId }`; see the Contacts reference).

**For real delivery state**, track the stored message's `status`, which advances asynchronously as WhatsApp sends acks: `sent → delivered → read`, or `failed` when WhatsApp reports an error for the message — which also dispatches a `message.failed` webhook. See the message shape under the Messages reference.

A message resting at `sent` is **not** diagnostic on its own. It means no ack has advanced it yet, and a registered recipient whose device has not come online since the send stays at `sent` indefinitely too — that is the designed behavior, not a fault. Use `contacts/check` to tell an unregistered number apart from a registered one that simply has not received yet.

## 6.4 REST API Reference

Every path below is prefixed with `/api`. Unless marked **public**, send `X-API-Key: <key>`; `OPERATOR`/`ADMIN` annotations require a key of at least that role. Responses are the raw payload (no envelope); list endpoints return a bare array.

### 6.4.1 Sessions

Base path `/api/sessions`. All routes that return a session return data shaped by `SessionResponseDto.fromEntity` (via `transformSession`), which **strips** `config` and the raw credential-bearing `proxyUrl` / `proxyType` columns and renames the entity field `lastActiveAt` to `lastActive`. Masked proxy details are available from `GET/PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/proxy` only. Session `status` wire values are lowercase: `created | initializing | qr_ready | authenticating | ready | disconnected | action_required | failed`.

#### GET /api/sessions

List all sessions, scoped to the API key's `allowedSessions`, ordered `createdAt` DESC.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped (a scoped key sees only its `allowedSessions`; an ADMIN / null-allowlist key lists all)

**Query parameters**

| Name     | Type             | Required | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `limit`  | integer (1-1000) | No       | `1000`  | Max sessions to return; oversized/non-finite values are clamped/fallback to the default window. |
| `offset` | integer          | No       | `0`     | Sessions to skip for paging; negative/non-finite values resolve to `0`.                         |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
    "name": "my-bot",
    "status": "ready",
    "phone": "6281234567890",
    "pushName": "My Bot",
    "connectedAt": "2026-06-25T08:14:02.000Z",
    "lastActive": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-20T11:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
    "lastError": null,
    "restriction": null,
    "engineLoaded": true
  }
]
```

`lastError` is non-null only when `status` is `failed` or `action_required`; any other status clears it. `config` and the raw `proxyUrl` / `proxyType` columns are not present (stripped by `fromEntity`).

`restriction` reports a limit **WhatsApp itself** has placed on the account, as opposed to `lastError`, which describes a fault on the gateway's side of the link. It is `null` when there is none, and otherwise `{ kind, code, expiresAt }`:

| `kind`              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                   | Engine          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `reachout_timelock` | The account stays connected and existing chats keep working; WhatsApp blocks only the **start of new conversations**. `expiresAt` carries the end of enforcement when WhatsApp states it. | Baileys         |
| `tos_block`         | WhatsApp Web refuses the link on Terms-of-Service grounds (`TOS_BLOCK`, or `SMB_TOS_BLOCK` for a business account).                                                                       | whatsapp-web.js |
| `proxy_block`       | WhatsApp Web refuses the egress address the session connects from (`PROXYBLOCK`) — about the route, not the account.                                                                      | whatsapp-web.js |

`code` is the engine's own token for the cause, passed through verbatim (`TOS_BLOCK`, `BIZ_QUALITY`, `WEB_COMPANION_ONLY`, …), so a value newer than your gateway build still reaches you rather than being flattened. Because `tos_block`/`proxy_block` prevent the session from linking at all, neither can appear alongside a `ready` status; a `reachout_timelock` can, and usually does. Like `engineLoaded`, the field is derived from live engine state, never persisted, and re-established on the next connect. Changes are also delivered as the `session.restriction` webhook.

`engineLoaded` reports whether the gateway holds a live engine for the session at the moment of the response. It is the precondition the lifecycle routes enforce, and **`status` is not a substitute for it**: `disconnected` covers both a session whose engine is still registered while an automatic reconnect backs off — where `POST /start` answers `400` — and one stopped through `POST /stop`, which has no engine and does need a start. When `engineLoaded` is `true`, `stop`, `logout` and `force-kill` can act; when it is `false`, `start` is the applicable route. The field is derived per request from live process state, so it is never persisted and never appears in historical/exported data.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId

Get a single session by ID.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped (key's `allowedSessions` enforced against `:sessionId`)

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description           |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------- |

  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": true
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/config

Get the effective tunable configuration for a session. Only the three recognised keys are reported,
resolved through the same clamps the engine applies — the opaque stored `config` column is never
echoed back (it is stripped from `SessionResponseDto` alongside the raw `proxyUrl` column, and anything else placed
in it is stored but ignored).

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped (key's `allowedSessions` enforced against `:sessionId`)

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "autoRejectCalls": false, "maxReconnectAttempts": null, "reconnectBaseDelay": 5000 }
```

`maxReconnectAttempts: null` means unlimited (the default); `reconnectBaseDelay` is milliseconds.
See §5 (Database Design) for what each key does and the moment it is read.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` session not found

#### PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/config

Merge a patch into the session's tunable configuration. No restart is required or performed:
omitted keys keep their stored value, and an explicit `null` clears a key back to its default (the
only way back to unlimited reconnect attempts once a cap is set). `autoRejectCalls` is re-read on
every incoming call, so it applies immediately; the two reconnect settings are read once per start
and therefore apply on the next start, leaving a reconnect sequence already in flight alone.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Request body** — `UpdateSessionConfigDto` (any subset; each key also accepts `null`)

| Field                  | Type    | Constraints               | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `autoRejectCalls`      | boolean | —                         | Auto-reject every incoming call as soon as it rings                |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | number  | integer, 0–20             | Reconnect attempt cap (`0` disables reconnect; `null` = unlimited) |
| `reconnectBaseDelay`   | number  | integer, 1000–300000 (ms) | Base delay of the reconnect backoff                                |

```json
{ "maxReconnectAttempts": 5 }
```

**Response** `200` — the resulting `SessionConfigResponseDto` (same shape as the GET above).

**Errors:** `400` a supplied value is outside its accepted range · `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/proxy

Read a session's masked proxy configuration. Credentials embedded in the stored `proxyUrl` are **never** returned — only the parsed `proxyHost:port`, a `proxyType` derived from the URL scheme, and a `hasCredentials` flag.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `200` — `SessionProxyResponseDto`

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "proxyType": "http",
  "proxyHost": "proxy.example.com:8080",
  "hasCredentials": true
}
```

When no proxy is configured, `enabled` is `false` and the other fields are `null`/`false`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` session not found

#### PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/proxy

Update per-session proxy settings. No restart is required or performed — changes apply on the **next** `POST /start`. Send `proxyUrl: null` to clear the proxy.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) that is not restricted to specific sessions. Redirecting a session's whole egress through a chosen host is a deployment-level act, and before this route existed `proxyUrl` could only be set through `POST /api/sessions`, which is unscoped for the same reason. A session-scoped key is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`).

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Request body** — `UpdateSessionProxyDto` (any subset; each key also accepts `null`)

**Response** `200` — the resulting `SessionProxyResponseDto` (same shape as the GET above).

**Errors:** `400` validation (bad `proxyUrl`) · `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the key is restricted to specific sessions · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/qr

Get the QR code (PNG data URL) for session authentication.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `200` — `QRCodeResponseDto`

```json
{
  "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  "status": "qr_ready"
}
```

`status` is the session's current lowercase status.

**Errors:** `400` session not started / QR not ready yet / already authenticated · `401` · `403` · `404` not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups

Get all groups the session is a member of (paginated).

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Query parameters**

| Name     | Type             | Required | Default | Description                         |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `limit`  | integer (1–1000) | No       | `1000`  | Max groups to return                |
| `offset` | integer          | No       | `0`     | Number of groups to skip for paging |

**Response** `200`

```json
[{ "id": "1234567890-123@g.us", "name": "Project Team", "linkedParentJID": null }]
```

Bare array mapped from the engine's group list then paginated. `linkedParentJID` is present for community-linked groups.

**Errors:** `400` session not started (engine not in memory) · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/chats

Get active chats for a session, most-recent first (paginated).

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Query parameters**

| Name     | Type             | Required | Default | Description              |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| `limit`  | integer (1–1000) | No       | `1000`  | Max chats to return      |
| `offset` | integer          | No       | `0`     | Chats to skip for paging |

**Response** `200` — `ChatSummary[]`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
    "name": "Alice",
    "isGroup": false,
    "kind": "individual",
    "unreadCount": 2,
    "timestamp": 1719306115,
    "lastMessage": "See you tomorrow",
    "archived": false,
    "pinned": false,
    "muted": false
  }
]
```

`archived`, `pinned` and `muted` are the read side of the `chats/archive`, `chats/pin` and
`chats/mute` endpoints. `muted` is the verdict; `muteExpiration`, present only when `muted` is true,
is the instant the mute ends in epoch milliseconds (`0` = indefinite), the same unit as
`chats/mute`'s `muteUntil`, so a value read here can be written straight back.

Sorted by `timestamp` DESC (most recent first) then paginated. `timestamp` is an epoch number (seconds). `kind` is the user-facing chat discriminator — one of `individual|group|channel|status|broadcast|unknown`; `isGroup` is retained for back-compat (true only for `kind: "group"`).

**Errors:** `400` session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `409` session not connected (also answered for a few seconds while WhatsApp Web reloads its page and the engine re-injects) · `503` page connection died mid-read

#### GET /api/sessions/stats/overview

Get session statistics for multi-session monitoring.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped (aggregate counts limited to the key's `allowedSessions`)

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "total": 4,
  "active": 2,
  "ready": 2,
  "disconnected": 1,
  "byStatus": { "ready": 2, "disconnected": 1, "created": 1 },
  "memoryUsage": { "heapUsed": 142, "heapTotal": 210, "rss": 318 }
}
```

`byStatus` is keyed by lowercase status values. `memoryUsage` values are megabytes (`Math.round(bytes / 1024 / 1024)`). `active` = count of running engines. A scoped key sees only its `allowedSessions` stats.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### POST /api/sessions

Create a new WhatsApp session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) that is not restricted to specific sessions. Creating a session is a deployment-level act: the new session is outside the caller's `allowedSessions` by construction, so a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`). An unscoped OPERATOR/ADMIN key may create a session.

**Request body** — `CreateSessionDto`

```json
{

  "config": { "autoReconnect": true }
}
```

Minimal: `{ "name": "my-bot" }`.

**Optional — per-session egress proxy.** Route a session's traffic through a proxy only if your
network cannot reach WhatsApp directly. Set `proxyUrl`/`proxyType` on the same request:

```json
{
  "name": "my-bot",
  "proxyUrl": "http://user:pass@your-real-proxy.host:8080",
  "proxyType": "http"
}
```

> ⚠ `proxyUrl` **must point at a real, reachable proxy server.** A placeholder or unreachable value
> (e.g. `http://proxy.example.com:8080`) launches the engine pinned to a dead proxy, so the WhatsApp
> WebSocket never connects, **no QR code is ever delivered**, and `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/start`
> returns `504 Gateway Timeout` after ~30s. Leave `proxyUrl` unset unless you genuinely need a proxy.

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",

  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:00:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": false
}
```

Like every other session route, this returns the `SessionResponseDto` shape (via `fromEntity`), so `config`, `proxyUrl` and `proxyType` are stripped and `lastActiveAt` appears as `lastActive`. Newly created `status` is `created`. Masked proxy details come only from `GET /api/sessions/{sessionId}/proxy`.

**Errors:** `400` validation (bad `name`/`proxyUrl`/`proxyType`, or an extra non-whitelisted field) · `401` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` session name already exists

}
```

Returned via `transformSession`. Status typically transitions to `initializing` / `qr_ready`.

**Errors:** `400` session already started / already starting · `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `409` credential teardown for the same session name still in flight (retryable; body carries `code: 'SESSION_NAME_TEARDOWN_PENDING'`; no destructive side effect runs before the refusal — a retry after cleanup settles proceeds)

  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:10:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": false
}
```

Returned via `transformSession`; status typically becomes `disconnected`.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `409` another node currently holds this session's live engine (multi-node deployments) · `502` `SESSION_STOP_INCOMPLETE` — session stopped locally but the engine teardown did not complete (retryable; the graceful disconnect and the force-destroy escalation both failed, status `disconnected`, no success audit)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/logout

Attempt an engine-native unlink of this companion device, then tear the session down locally.

`stop` disconnects while keeping the stored credentials, and `delete` additionally purges the
on-disk auth directories and the session row, but neither tells WhatsApp anything: the device stays
listed under the account holder's **Linked Devices** on the phone until they remove it by hand.
`logout` attempts the engine-native unlink operation itself.

A `200` means the engine-native unlink operation **and** the required local credential cleanup both
completed — for Baileys, a valid companion identity, an acknowledged `remove-companion-device` IQ
response, and removal of the on-disk auth dir; for whatsapp-web.js, the native `Client.logout()`
promise (including `LocalAuth.logout()`) settled. `200` is **not** an independent observation that
the handset UI no longer shows the linked device — only the linked device itself can observe that,
and callers must not claim otherwise. Because a completed unlink wipes the stored credentials, a
later `start` always requires a fresh QR scan or pairing code.

The session must be running — the unlink is a network round-trip that needs a live engine, so a
stopped session is rejected with `400` (the row is left untouched) rather than reported as a success
that never reached WhatsApp.

If the engine-backed logout attempt does not complete, the session is still torn down locally
(map reconciled, status `disconnected`) but the route returns `502` with a stable
`code: 'SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE'`: no send / no acknowledgement / timeout or transport error / or
a local-cleanup failure. `phone` is cleared on this path and **no** `session_logged_out` audit row
is written (that audit is only written on the `200` path). Start the session again and retry the
logout. Do not assume the retry reconnects automatically or lands in a guaranteed QR state — whether
the old credentials remain usable depends on where the failure happened, and the route does not
report which.

With `AUTO_START_SESSIONS=true`, auto-start selects sessions whose `phone` is non-null. Both a `200`
and a `502` logout clear `phone`, and a WhatsApp-initiated unlink reported by a running engine clears
it the same way, so none of those are auto-started on boot — an incomplete-logout (`502`)
session must be started explicitly and the logout retried by hand. A session that must stay down can
simply be left as-is.

  "engineLoaded": false
}
```

Returned via `transformSession`; status becomes `disconnected` and `phone` is cleared (so the boot
auto-start does not resurrect the session). Recorded in the audit log as `session_logged_out`,
distinguishing an intentional unlink from a plain stop.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started (no engine to send through; the row is left untouched) · `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `502` `SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE` — session stopped locally but the logout operation did not complete (retryable; `phone` cleared, no success audit)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/force-kill

Force-kill a stuck session (SIGKILL the wedged engine, then tear it down).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/pairing-code

Request an 8-char pairing code to link via phone number (alternative to QR).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

```

**Response** `201` — `PairingCodeResponseDto`

```json
{ "pairingCode": "ABCD1234", "status": "qr_ready" }
```

`status` is the lowercase session status.

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started, or already authenticated · `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `409` session not waiting to be linked yet; wait for `status` to read `qr_ready` and retry (after a code was accepted, wait for `ready` instead). On Baileys a session that already reads `qr_ready` can still answer `409` while its socket is closing, for up to the WebSocket close timeout (30 s); that is retryable and the status follows shortly.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/presence/subscribe

Ask WhatsApp to start reporting who is online or typing in a chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped · **Engines:** Baileys only

There is no synchronous answer: presence cannot be _fetched_ from either engine, only received.
Updates arrive as the `presence.update` webhook and socket event; the latest is readable at
`GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/presence/:chatId`.

Two properties to design around:

- **The subscription belongs to the connection.** It does not survive a restart or an automatic
  reconnect, and must be re-issued. The gateway does not silently replay subscriptions, because a
  replay would report a presence the account never actually asked for.
- **Subscribe per chat, not to everything.** WhatsApp emits an update on every transition — each time
  someone starts and stops typing — so a broad subscription is a firehose. Only genuine state
  _changes_ are dispatched onward, which bounds the event volume but not the socket traffic.

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Request body** — `SubscribePresenceDto`

| Field    | Type   | Required | Constraints                                                                                 | Description                                                                           |

| `chatId` | string | Yes      | `@IsString`; `@IsNotEmpty`; `@Matches(/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+$/)` (localpart@host, no whitespace) | Engine-native JID, e.g. `1234567890@c.us` (wwebjs) or `1234@s.whatsapp.net` (Baileys) |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `501` the active engine cannot observe presence (whatsapp-web.js exposes only `sendPresenceAvailable`/`sendPresenceUnavailable`, which publish the account's _own_ presence, and emits no presence event) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/presence/:chatId

The last presence reported for a chat.

**Auth:** API key (VIEWER) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "chatId": "1234567890@c.us",
  "participants": [{ "id": "1234567890@c.us", "state": "composing", "lastSeen": 1786000000 }],
  "observedAt": "2026-08-03T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`state` is one of `available` / `unavailable` / `composing` / `recording` / `paused` — the middle two
mean actively typing or recording _in this chat_, `paused` means they stopped without sending.
`lastSeen` is epoch **seconds** and is absent whenever the contact's privacy settings hide last-seen,
which is the default for most accounts and is not an error. `groupOnlineCount` appears for groups
when WhatsApp reports it. A 1:1 chat still returns a `participants` array, holding the one contact.

`observedAt` is when **this gateway** received the report, not a WhatsApp timestamp. Presence is
short-lived, so an old `observedAt` means the state is stale rather than steady.

The body is `null` when nothing has been reported — the chat was never subscribed, or nothing has
changed since. That is a normal state rather than a missing resource, so it is `200` with a null
body, not a `404`. Presence is held in memory and never persisted: answering "typing" from before a
restart would be worse than answering nothing.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` session not found

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/presence

Set the account's OWN global presence: appear online or offline. WhatsApp routes notifications away
from the phone while a linked device announces itself online, so a headless bot that never goes
offline suppresses the phone's own alerts — `available: false` hands them back. Supported on both
engines.

The setting belongs to the connection: it does not survive a restart or reconnect and must be
re-issued after `session.status` reports one. Not best-effort — a failure surfaces instead of
leaving the account silently online.

Baileys acknowledges individual messages rather than chats, and the receipt enumerates ids instead of carrying a read-up-to watermark. Without `messageIds` only the newest message the engine still holds in memory gets a receipt, so a burst leaves its earlier messages unread and a session restarted since the message arrived has nothing to acknowledge at all. Each supplied id is resolved through the message store, which is what carries the `participant` a group receipt needs. Ignored by whatsapp-web.js, whose own `sendSeen` is chat-level.

```json
{ "chatId": "1234567890@c.us", "messageIds": ["3EB0C767D26B8A3F1A2B", "3EB0C767D26B8A3F1A2C"] }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

Returns HTTP `200`, matching the OpenAPI contract.

> **`success: false` is a real outcome on the Baileys engine.** The read receipt is sent against the
> chat's last known message, so a chat the session has seen no message in is reported as declined
> rather than marked read. The whatsapp-web.js engine reads the chat from the page and needs no local
> history, so it never produces this outcome.

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget, or the engine’s browser page died — the change may or may not have been applied

**Response** `200`

```json

```

> **`muteUntil` is required, and `null` is not the same as omitting it.** The two plausible readings

> with a `400` instead of guessing. Send `null` to unmute. To mute indefinitely, send a far-future
> timestamp: neither engine exposes a portable "forever" value (whatsapp-web.js uses `-1` internally,
> Baileys has none), so the API keeps one well-defined shape.

> **Milliseconds, not seconds.** This was measured against a live WhatsApp account rather than read
> off the protocol: the app-state field is the unsuffixed `MuteAction.muteEndTimestamp` while the same
> proto spells other millisecond fields `…Ms`, which reads as seconds and is wrong. A seconds-scale
> value is an instant in 1970, so the mute expires the moment it is set — and the request still
> answers `200`, because nothing in the chain rejects a timestamp in the past.

> **Unlike `chats/archive`, there is no declined outcome.** The mute change is not keyed to the chat's
> last message on either engine, so a chat with no known history mutes like any other. The response is
> always `{ "success": true }` or an error.

**Errors:** `400` session not ready, invalid `chatId`/`muteUntil`, or a `chatId` the whatsapp-web.js engine cannot resolve (the Baileys engine writes the mute without resolving the chat first and answers `success: true` for a chat that does not exist) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` session not found · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget, or the engine’s browser page died — the change may or may not have been applied

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/chats/pin

Pin a chat to the top of the chat list, or unpin it. Chat-level — distinct from
`messages/pin`, which pins a message inside a chat.

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |

```json
{ "chatId": "1234567890-123@g.us", "pin": true }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

> **`success: false` means WhatsApp refused the pin, and only a pin can be refused.** WhatsApp allows
> at most **three** pinned chats. On the whatsapp-web.js engine a fourth pin returns `success: false`
> without changing anything. Unpinning always succeeds.

> **The Baileys engine cannot see that cap.** It writes an app-state patch and WhatsApp reports
> nothing back, so it answers `success: true` for every accepted request — including a fourth pin
> that WhatsApp may then decline on its own. Treat `true` on that engine as "the request was sent",
> not "the chat is pinned". Unlike `chats/archive` the patch is not keyed to the chat's last message,
> so a chat with no known history pins normally.

**Errors:** `400` session not ready, or a `chatId` the whatsapp-web.js engine cannot resolve (the Baileys engine answers `success: true` for a chat that does not exist) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` session not found · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget, or the engine’s browser page died — the change may or may not have been applied

```json
{ "chatId": "1234567890-123@g.us" }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

Returns HTTP `200`, matching the OpenAPI contract.

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget, or the engine’s browser page died — the change may or may not have been applied

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/chats/typing

Send a typing/recording presence indicator to a chat (or clear it with `paused`).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |

```json
{ "chatId": "1234567890@c.us", "state": "typing" }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

Always returns `{ "success": true }` (the service returns void; the controller hardcodes `true`).

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId

Delete a session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `sessionId` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `204` — empty body (`@HttpCode(204)`, returns void). A `findOne` lookup runs first, so a missing id yields `404`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` session not found · `409` credential teardown for the same session name still in flight (retryable; body carries `code: 'SESSION_NAME_TEARDOWN_PENDING'`; on a `409` the row is **not** deleted and no hook/auth-purge runs — retry after cleanup settles)

### 6.4.2 Messages

All routes are mounted under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/messages`. Reads (`GET` history, batch status, reactions) accept any valid API key (including VIEWER). All write/send routes require **API key (OPERATOR)** or higher. Single-recipient send routes return `MessageResponseDto { messageId, timestamp }` (`timestamp` is an epoch **number** in seconds; there is no `status` field); `POST send-bulk` instead returns `202` with `BulkMessageResponseDto`. The global ValidationPipe runs `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`, so any body field not listed below is rejected with `400`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages

Get persisted message history for a session from the local DB (paginated, filterable). Reads the DB only — does not hit WhatsApp.

    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Each `Message`: `{ id (uuid), sessionId, waMessageId (string|null), chatId, from, to, body (string|null), type, direction ('incoming'|'outgoing'), timestamp (number|null), metadata (object|null), status ('pending'|'sent'|'delivered'|'read'|'failed'), createdAt (ISO date) }`. Ordered by `createdAt` DESC, then by a dialect-dependent second key. The tiebreaker matters: `createdAt` is not unique (SQLite stores whole seconds, a PostgreSQL bulk write ties every row it inserts, and a history backfill carries WhatsApp's own second-resolution timestamp), and without a total order two pages of one walk can repeat a row and omit another. On SQLite the second key is `rowid`, the stored insertion sequence, so messages sharing a second come back in the order they arrived. PostgreSQL has no equivalent (`ctid` moves on every ack update), so it keeps `id`, a random uuid: the walk is equally correct there, but a same-second group is not in arrival order. Note that `offset` still addresses a position by count, so a list taking concurrent writes can shift under a walk: a message arriving mid-walk pushes every older row down one, and the next page re-serves a row the previous one already returned. Pass `after` instead to walk a live chat safely; it anchors on the last row you received, which an arriving message cannot move. The response is the raw service object (no envelope). Unlike the live `IncomingMessage` shape below, this persisted `Message` does **not** carry `kind` — re-derive the chat kind from `chatId` (see `ChatKind` / `chatKind()`) if needed.

> **Inline media is carried up to a budget, then omitted.** `MESSAGE_LIST_INLINE_MEDIA_BUDGET_BYTES` (8 MiB of encoded base64 by default) bounds how much inline media one response may hold across its rows. A row is not a bounded object — `limit` is clamped to `[1,100]` but each row can carry its base64 in `metadata.media.data`, so a page of media rows could otherwise reach hundreds of megabytes and fail the read outright. The budget is spent newest-first, matching the `createdAt` DESC order above, so a page that cannot carry everything keeps the most recent media. Past it a payload is replaced with `{ mimetype, filename?, omitted: true, sizeBytes }` — the same marker the engine emits for inbound media over `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` — and the bytes remain available from [`GET /messages/:chatId/:messageId/media`](#get-apisessionssessionidmessageschatidmessageidmedia). Two rules bound the edges: the newest payload is always inlined even when it alone exceeds the budget (otherwise a single large photo would be permanently unreadable through this route), and a budget of `0` means "never inline" and grants no such allowance. The knob is validated at boot — `8MiB` would parse to 8 bytes — and is forwarded by both compose files. The MCP `MessageList` tool shares this path and the same budget.

**Errors:** `400` `after` names no message in this session · `401` missing/invalid API key

A blank `after` is treated as absent, the way a blank `limit` or `offset` already is, so a client
templating a cursor it has not got yet keeps the unfiltered first page rather than a `400`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/history

Fetch chat history live from WhatsApp for a chat, bypassing the local DB.

**Response** `200`

Returns a bare array of engine-neutral `IncomingMessage` objects:

Each item may also include `isStatusBroadcast`, `mentionedIds`, `isLidSender`, `ephemeralDuration` (the chat's disappearing-messages timer in seconds, present only when one is set), `contact`, `media { mimetype, filename?, data?, omitted?, sizeBytes? }`, `quotedMessage { id, body }`, `call { video, missed }` (for `call` messages), `location { latitude, longitude, description?, address?, url? }`, `order { orderId, token? }` (for `order` messages) and `product { productId, title?, description?, businessOwnerJid? }` (for `product` messages). `senderPhone` is **not** among them: this endpoint reads live from the engine and performs no privacy-id resolution, which runs only on the inbound `message.received` path (§6.6). To map an `@lid` sender seen here, call `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/phone`. `type` is one of `text|image|video|audio|voice|document|sticker|location|contact|poll|call|revoked|order|product|masked|unknown`. An `order` is a cart the customer placed from the business catalog and a `product` is a single catalog product shared into the chat. Both engines populate the ids. The message carries no line items and this API exposes no order lookup, so `orderId` plus the single-order `token` are a correlation handle you redeem elsewhere rather than something the catalog routes resolve; `productId` resolves through `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog/products/:productId` only when the product came from the session's own catalog (`businessOwnerJid` says whose it is). Sharing a whole catalog rather than one product carries no product id and stays `unknown`. A `masked` message is one WhatsApp deliberately withholds from linked/companion devices — e.g. a high-security business OTP — so its `body` is empty by design (the content is only available on the primary phone) rather than a parsing failure; this occurs on the Baileys engine. `kind` is the user-facing chat discriminator of `chatId` — one of `individual|group|channel|status|broadcast|unknown`; it supersedes `isStatusBroadcast` (equivalent to `kind === 'status'`), which is retained for back-compat.

**Errors:** `400` session not active, or `durationSeconds` outside the three accepted values · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` the whatsapp-web.js engine refused the pin (in a group only admins may pin; the Baileys engine has no acceptance signal and answers `200`) · `404` message not found in the chat · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-request; a retry is safe but restarts the pin duration

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/star

Star (bookmark) a message, or remove its star. Starring is private to the account — the other party
never sees it — and unlike pinning it has no group-admin restriction and never expires.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/:messageId/media

Download a message's **stored** media bytes.

The route serves the chat-media **archive** first, and falls back to the **inline base64 copy** on
the message row when no archived file is servable. Archiving is **opt-in and off by default**
(`CHAT_MEDIA_ARCHIVE_ENABLED`); when enabled, each inbound message's media is written to whatever
backs `StorageService` (local disk or S3) in addition to the inline copy. Media **sent by this
account** is archived too when `CHAT_MEDIA_ARCHIVE_OUTBOUND=true` is set alongside it — off by
default, since it doubles storage again for the outbound half.

Media sent by this account is downloadable here regardless of that flag, because its payload is
stored inline: base64 API sends persist it on the send path, and media composed on a linked phone is
downloaded by the engine for the own-send echo. The flag buys a durable copy with its own lifecycle
(S3 portability, TTL retention), not retrievability. A **URL-based send is the exception**: the
gateway fetches those bytes at send time and stores none, so there is nothing to serve or archive.

The inline fallback also keeps an inbound message's media downloadable after
`CHAT_MEDIA_ARCHIVE_TTL_DAYS` retention purges the archived file, since retention leaves the inline
copy in place.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID                                  |
| chatId    | string | Chat ID containing the message              |
| messageId | string | WhatsApp message ID whose media to download |

**Response** `200` — the raw media bytes as the response body, served as an **attachment**
(`Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`). `Content-Type` is the stored
mimetype when it is in a conservative inert set (common image/video/audio types) and
`application/octet-stream` otherwise — a document, or an `image/svg+xml`, is never served as active
content on the API origin.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session · `404`
`No media stored for this message` — the message carries no media, `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=false`
or the media was above `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` when it was stored (the row holds a size-only
marker), it was a URL-based API send (the gateway fetches those bytes at send time and never stores
them), or the message is not in this gateway's history (e.g. history backfill, which is media-free)

Note: this is a three-path-segment route, so it never collides with the two-segment
`GET /messages/:chatId/history` regardless of declaration order.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/batch/:batchId

Get the processing status and progress of a bulk batch.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| batchId   | string | Batch ID    |

**Response** `200`

```json

  "batchId": "batch_a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": { "total": 2, "sent": 1, "failed": 0, "pending": 1, "cancelled": 0 },

  ],
  "startedAt": "2026-06-25T09:20:55.000Z",
  "completedAt": null
}
```

`status` is one of `pending|processing|completed|cancelled|failed`; per-result `status` is `pending|sent|failed|cancelled`. A failed result carries a sanitized `error { code, message }` (internals are not leaked).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` batch not found for this session

### Send pacing (opt-in, `429 SEND_PACING_LIMITED`)

Every outbound message send — the `messages/send-*` routes, `messages/edit`, `messages/forward`,
bulk batches, status posts and the catalog send (`messages/send-product`) — passes an optional pacing governor before
it reaches WhatsApp. Actions on existing messages (react, vote, pin, star) are not sends and are
not paced. It is **off by default**: unless `SEND_PACING_ENABLED=true`, nothing is refused and no
extra work is done.

When enabled, three rules can refuse a send:

| Rule              | What it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Warm-up daily cap | The session has used its allowance for the current **UTC** day. The allowance grows with the session's age (`SEND_PACING_WARMUP_SCHEDULE`), because a brand-new WhatsApp account that immediately sends at volume is the pattern that gets numbers banned. The count comes from the messages table, so it survives restarts — and so it only sees sends that write a row there. Status posts, message edits and Baileys product sends are checked against the cap but never counted into it — none of them writes a row, and an edit only updates one — and neither is a bulk item the engine refuses, because bulk persists its row only after the send succeeds. A session using any of them can exceed its stated allowance. A bulk item that succeeds is counted, as is a failed single send, whose PENDING row is kept as FAILED. |
| Cold-reachout cap | The session has used its allowance of **new conversations** for the UTC day (`SEND_PACING_COLD_DAILY_CAP`). A send is a cold reachout when the account has no history with that chat in **either** direction — replying to someone who wrote to you first is never counted, and never refused by this rule. Status posts address no chat and are exempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Failure breaker   | Consecutive send failures reached `SEND_PACING_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`, which usually means WhatsApp has already started refusing this account. The streak has no time decay — only a successful send resets it, so failures spread across a long quiet period still accumulate toward the threshold. Sends resume after `SEND_PACING_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS`, or immediately after any send succeeds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A refusal is `429` with a body carrying **`code: "SEND_PACING_LIMITED"`** and `retryAfterSeconds`:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Daily allowance of 5 new conversation(s) reached for a session 0 day(s) old",
  "code": "SEND_PACING_LIMITED",
  "retryAfterSeconds": 34521
}
```

The `code` is what distinguishes it from the **global rate limiter's** own `429`, which carries no
`code`. The difference matters to a client: the throttler's 429 clears in seconds, a daily cap does
not. Do not retry a `SEND_PACING_LIMITED` response before `retryAfterSeconds`.

Inside a bulk batch a refusal fails just that item (honouring `stopOnError`), not the batch — the
allowance may free up, and a batch killed outright could not be resumed.

**Group participant adds draw on the same cold budget.** `POST .../groups/:groupId/participants` and
`POST .../groups` put the account in front of people who did not ask for it, in bulk, in a single
call — the most ban-associated action available — so each participant the account has no history
with costs one cold reachout. A repeated id costs one; participants already known cost nothing. The
whole request is refused rather than partially applied, so a `429` can never be confused with the
per-participant failures those endpoints report normally. No message is sent, so neither call
consumes the overall daily send allowance.

Two consequences worth knowing: a paced-out send fires **no** `message:sending` plugin hook (see
`docs/19-plugin-architecture.md`), and refusals are counted in the `openwa_send_pacing_refusals_total`
Prometheus counter, labelled by rule.

```

**Link previews.** Sending `false` stops the preview on both engines. The two differ on what
happens otherwise: whatsapp-web.js lets WhatsApp Web build one in-page (free, so it is the default),
while on Baileys the gateway must fetch the page itself — a blocking outbound request per URL before
the message can go out — so there a preview is **opt-in**:

|                      | whatsapp-web.js                                                       | Baileys                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `linkPreview: false` | no preview                                                            | no preview                                         |
| unset                | asks WhatsApp Web to build a preview in-page                          | no preview                                         |
| `linkPreview: true`  | asks WhatsApp Web to build a preview in-page                          | the gateway fetches the page itself and builds one |
| `customLinkPreview`  | `501` — the library takes a boolean only, with no way to pass a title | preview attached verbatim, nothing fetched         |

**How Baileys previews are generated.** Not with the library's own generator. That one delegates to
`link-preview-js`, which carries an unfixed SSRF advisory
([GHSA-4gp8-rjrq-ch6q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gp8-rjrq-ch6q), CWE-918 — "IPv6 and
internal loopback attacks", no patched release). Since the URL comes from message text, an attacker
influences what this server fetches, so the gateway supplies its own generator instead: it fetches
through the same SSRF guard used elsewhere, which validates the destination **and pins the
connection to the vetted address**, closing the DNS-rebinding window a validate-then-delegate
approach would leave open. `WEBHOOK_SSRF_PROTECT` and `SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` apply, so a deployment
that intentionally allows an internal host keeps that behaviour. A refused, slow or broken site
yields no preview — never a failed send.

`customLinkPreview` fetches **nothing at all**, so it works for URLs this server cannot reach, and it
cannot be combined with `linkPreview: false` — that asks for the opposite, and the request is
rejected with `400` rather than guessing which half was meant.

> whatsapp-web.js's own documentation notes the flag "has no effect on multi-device accounts". Its
> code does act on the flag, but that caveat is upstream's and is repeated here rather than
> contradicted — if a preview still appears on a multi-device account despite `false`, that is why.

```json
{ "chatId": "120363000000000000@g.us", "text": "Hello @62811", "mentions": ["62811@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{ "messageId": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD", "timestamp": 1719312000 }
```

`messageId` is the WhatsApp message id from the engine. An optional `SIMULATE_TYPING` humanising pause may run before send.

**Errors:** `400` unknown body field, validation failure, or session not active / blocked by a plugin hook · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` session not found · `500` engine error · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` not supported on the active engine

##### Quoted sends

Nine `send-*` routes accept an optional `quotedMessageId`: `send-text` above, and `send-image`,
`send-video`, `send-audio`, `send-document`, `send-sticker`, `send-location`, `send-contact` and
`send-poll` below. Supplying it turns that send into a reply, so a reply can carry media, a location,
a contact card or a poll — not only text. `POST .../messages/reply` remains the text shorthand, and
like the send routes it accepts `mentions`.

`send-template`, `send-bulk` and `send-product` do NOT accept the field, and reject it
as an unknown property.

```json
{
  "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
  "contactName": "Alice",
  "contactNumber": "628999888777",
  "quotedMessageId": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD"
}
```

**The id is engine-specific and is deliberately not harmonised.**

|                      | whatsapp-web.js                                  | Baileys                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| id to supply         | the serialized message id (`true_<chat>_<hash>`) | the raw message key id            |
| where it is resolved | in the WhatsApp Web page                         | the gateway's local message store |
| message not found    | `404` — the send is refused                      | `404` — the send is refused       |

An id the engine cannot resolve **fails the send** rather than delivering the message unquoted. On
whatsapp-web.js that is a deliberate choice: the library's default is to send anyway and report
success, which would hand back `201` for a message that is not a reply.

One upstream gap remains on whatsapp-web.js and cannot be switched off from here: if the quoted
message resolves but the page decides it is not replyable, the message is sent without the quote and
the call still succeeds.

Quoting a message from a **different chat** is not validated on these `send-*` routes on either
engine; the id is passed through as given. `POST /messages/reply` is stricter: both engines refuse a
quoted id that does not belong to the target chat, with `404`.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-audio

Send an audio message (by URL or base64). Uses `SendAudioMessageDto`. A `caption` is accepted by the DTO but not persisted for audio. Set `ptt: true` to send a real WhatsApp **voice note** (microphone bubble + waveform) instead of a plain audio file. `ptt` is a JSON boolean, exclusive to this endpoint, and — because voice notes require `audio/ogg; codecs=opus` — the server defaults the mimetype to that when you set `ptt` without one; for reliable playback (especially on the Baileys engine, which does not transcode) supply OGG/Opus bytes. A `ptt` voice note is stored as message `type: "voice"`.

**Engine differences:** Baileys always sends a document as a document, while whatsapp-web.js deliberately keeps normal mimetype classification for `status@broadcast` and broadcast lists — the library returns `null` for document-mode sends to those recipients, so forcing the flag there would turn a working send into a failure. For URL-based sends without an explicit `filename`, whatsapp-web.js derives the URL basename; Baileys falls back to the literal `file`.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-bulk

Send messages to multiple recipients as an async batch — returns immediately and processes in the background.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |

| sessionId | string | Session ID  |

**Request body** — `SendBulkMessageDto`

| Field    | Type                  | Required | Constraints                      | Description                                                                                                               |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| batchId  | string                | No       | string                           | Auto-generated `batch_<hex>` if omitted; a duplicate id returns `400`                                                     |
| messages | BulkMessageItemDto[]  | Yes      | array, max 100, nested-validated | The batch items (see below); duplicate `chatId`s are collapsed before processing — first occurrence wins, order preserved |
| options  | BulkMessageOptionsDto | No       | nested-validated                 | Pacing/error options (see below)                                                                                          |

Each `BulkMessageItemDto`: `{ chatId: string, type: 'text'|'image'|'video'|'audio'|'document', content: BulkMessageContentDto, variables?: Record<string,string> }`. `content` (all fields optional, nested-validated): `text?: string`, `image?`/`video?`/`audio?`/`document?`: `{ url?, base64?, mimetype?, filename? }`, `caption?: string`, `mentions?: string[]` (per item; a batch fans out to many chats, and a WID is only taggable in a chat the participant is in).

`BulkMessageOptionsDto`: `{ delayBetweenMessages?: number (1000–60000, default 3000), randomizeDelay?: boolean (default true), stopOnError?: boolean (default false) }`.

Each item's base64 media is checked against the media byte cap (`MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES`) twice: at batch creation, and again per item after `variables` and the `message:sending` plugin gate are applied. An item that outgrows the cap only after rendering fails individually (`failed` in `results`, with `message:failed` fired) instead of being sent. `totalMessages` in the response reflects the de-duplicated item count.

The rendered text is bounded the same way, by `TEMPLATE_RENDER_MAX_CHARS` (default 64 KiB) — the limit the single-send template path already applied. `content.text` and `content.caption` are length-validated _before_ substitution, so caller-supplied `variables` could otherwise inflate each item without bound while the request body stayed far below the in-flight body budget. An item whose `text` or `caption` exceeds the limit after substitution fails individually with a message naming it, rather than being truncated silently or sent. Media is not bounded by this cap — `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` governs it, three orders of magnitude higher, because a 100 KB image is already ~137,000 base64 characters and would fail the character limit on every personalised media send.

```

**Response** `202`

`202 Accepted` (via `@HttpCode`). `statusUrl` points at the batch-status route below.

```json

}
```

**Errors:** `400` session not active, duplicate `batchId`, or DTO/nested validation failure (unknown nested field rejected) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `413` base64 media over the media cap (see §6.3) · `500` engine error

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/batch/:batchId/cancel

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |

  "status": "cancelled",
  "progress": { "total": 2, "sent": 1, "failed": 0, "pending": 0, "cancelled": 1 }

**Errors:** `400` batch already completed or cancelled · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` batch not found

### 6.4.3 Contacts

Contact endpoints are scoped under a session: `/api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts`. All read routes require a valid API key; the block/unblock writes require an `OPERATOR` key. Every route returns `400 "Session is not started"` when the target session is missing entirely or is not in a started/ready state (the engine guard does not distinguish the two). Responses are the raw handler payload (no envelope).

The `Contact` object returned by the list and get-by-id routes has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "pushName": "Jane",
  "number": "6281234567890",
  "isMyContact": true,
  "isBlocked": false,
  "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
}
```

`name`, `pushName`, and `profilePicUrl` are optional and may be absent.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts

List all contacts for a session, returned as an in-memory paginated window.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |

| limit  | integer | No       | 1000    | Parsed with `parseInt(…,10)`; clamped to `[1, 1000]`. Omitted or non-finite values fall back to 1000. |
| offset | integer | No       | 0       | Parsed with `parseInt(…,10)`; non-finite values fall back to 0, then truncated to `>= 0`.             |

**Response** `200` — bare `Contact[]` array

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "pushName": "Jane",

    "isMyContact": true,
    "isBlocked": false,
    "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the WhatsApp page died while reading contacts (retry shortly)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/blocked

The contacts this account has blocked — the read half of the block/unblock endpoints. A bare array
of neutral contact ids, and ids only: whatsapp-web.js resolves full contact models, but Baileys'
blocklist query answers bare jids, and inventing the other fields on one engine would make the two
engines claim different things about the same account.

**Auth:** API key

**Response** `200`

```json
["628123456789@c.us", "628987654321@c.us"]
```

**Errors:** `400` session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `409` engine not ready · `503` WhatsApp did not answer the blocklist query (on Baileys the gateway bounds the query with its own clock — an unanswered query is a `503`, never an empty list)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/check/:number

Check whether a phone number exists on WhatsApp and return its canonical WhatsApp id when it does.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                                             |
| number    | string | Phone number to check, e.g. `628123456789` (digits, no `@c.us` suffix). |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "number": "628123456789",
  "exists": true,
  "whatsappId": "628123456789@c.us"
}
```

`whatsappId` is the canonical native chat id, or `null` when the number is not on WhatsApp; `exists` is `whatsappId !== null`.

> Route-order caveat: this route is two path segments (`check/:number`), so it never collides with the single-segment `GET /:contactId` — a contact id of literally `check` resolves to `GET /:contactId`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId

Get a single contact by its WhatsApp id.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                               |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                               |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us` or an `@lid`. |

**Response** `200` — `Contact`

```json
{
  "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "pushName": "Jane",
  "number": "6281234567890",
  "isMyContact": true,
  "isBlocked": false,
  "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Contact <id> not found` (engine returned null) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-read, so the lookup reached no answer (distinct from the `404`, which asserts the contact does not exist)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/profile-picture

Get the profile picture URL for a contact (best-effort).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                  |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                  |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "url": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..." }
```

`url` is `null` when there is no picture or the contact's privacy hides it — both are answers. A
lookup that could not reach an answer is **not** reported this way; it answers `503`, so a caller can
tell "this contact has no avatar" from "we could not find out".

> The path segment is `profile-picture` (hyphenated), not `profile-pic`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the engine could not complete the lookup

Note the batch route below keeps its best-effort contract: it has no per-id error channel, so a
failed lookup there still appears as `null`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/profile-pictures

Batch-resolve profile picture URLs for many contacts in one request (a chat sidebar would otherwise fire a burst of single fetches and exhaust the per-IP throttle).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |

| Name | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ids  | string | Yes      | Comma-separated contact ids. Blank entries are dropped; only the **first 50** ids are looked up, the rest are ignored (they simply do not appear in the response). |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "pictures": {
    "6281234567890@c.us": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/...",
    "6289876543210@c.us": null
  }
}
```

`pictures` is keyed by the requested id. A per-id failure — or a lookup that exceeds the 8 s per-id deadline — yields `null` for that id rather than failing the batch. An omitted or empty `ids` returns `{ "pictures": {} }`.

> Route-order caveat: `profile-pictures` is declared **before** `GET /:contactId`, so the literal segment wins — a contact whose id is literally `profile-pictures` cannot be fetched through the single-contact route.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/phone

Resolve a contact id (e.g. an `@lid`) to a phone number (MSISDN digits), best-effort.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                  |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                  |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID to resolve, e.g. an `@lid`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "contactId": "12345678901234@lid", "phone": "6281234567890" }
```

`phone` is `null` when the engine cannot map the id (e.g. an `@lid` the account has never seen).

For inbound messages the gateway can attach this automatically instead: `RESOLVE_LID_TO_PHONE=true` adds `senderPhone` to every `message.received` payload (§6.6). It is off by default; this endpoint works either way.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId

Save a contact to the account's addressbook, or edit an existing entry. This is the WhatsApp
contact record — it does not block, delete, or otherwise touch the chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                     |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID                      |
| contactId | string | Contact ID (e.g. `628xxx@c.us`) |

**Request body** — `UpsertContactDto`

| Field     | Type   | Required | Constraints | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| firstName | string | Yes      | 1–100 chars | The contact's first name                               |
| lastName  | string | No       | ≤ 100 chars | Omit for a single-name contact — WhatsApp allows those |

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Contact saved" }`

> The entry is saved to the WhatsApp addressbook only; it is **not** synced through to the device
> addressbook. Both engines are called with their sync-to-device flag off, so behaviour matches
> across engines rather than depending on which one is running.

> **A privacy id (`…@lid`) is refused with `400`.** The addressbook is keyed by phone number, and a
> lid's digits are not one — whatsapp-web.js takes a bare number here, so an unguarded lid would be
> stored as if it were a real phone. Pass a phone-based contact id instead.

**Errors:** `400` session not active, invalid request, or a `@lid` contact id · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId

Remove a contact from the account's addressbook. Does not block the contact or delete the chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Contact deleted" }`

**Errors:** `400` session not active, or a `@lid` contact id (same reason as the `PUT` above) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/block

Block a contact.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                  |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                  |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

This route takes no request body and binds no DTO. Send an empty body `{}` (the global `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted` ValidationPipe rejects any unexpected field with `400`).

**Response** `200`

This route is annotated `@HttpCode(200)`, so it returns `200` rather than the POST default `201`.

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Contact blocked" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started, or the id does not name an individual (group/newsletter/broadcast/free text are refused on both engines; a phone-based or privacy `@lid` id is accepted, because the blocklist read answers both shapes) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/block

Unblock a contact.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                  |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.                                  |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

No request body.

**Response** `200`

No `@HttpCode` override is present, so this DELETE returns the NestJS default `200` (not `204`).

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Contact unblocked" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started, or the id does not name an individual (group/newsletter/broadcast/free text are refused on both engines; a phone-based or privacy `@lid` id is accepted, because the blocklist read answers both shapes) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

### 6.4.4 Groups

All group routes are nested under a session: base path `/api/sessions/:sessionId/groups`. Reads (`GET`) require a plain API key; writes (create/modify/leave/revoke) require an `OPERATOR` role key. All routes resolve the engine for the session first, so a session that is not started yields `400 Session is not started`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups

List all groups for a session, with pagination.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |

**Query parameters**

| Name   | Type                              | Required | Default | Description                                                            |

| limit  | string (parsed base-10 to number) | No       | 1000    | Max groups to return; clamped to [1, 1000]. Omitted/non-finite → 1000. |
| offset | string (parsed base-10 to number) | No       | 0       | Groups to skip. Non-finite → 0; negative truncated to 0.               |

**Response** `200`

Raw array (no envelope). The service calls `engine.getGroups()`, projects each entry down to `id`/`name`/`linkedParentJID`, then paginates to bound the window. Anything else the engine's group object may carry is dropped by that projection — use `GET /groups/:groupId` (participants, settings, owner) when you need more than the identity.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
    "name": "Project Team",
    "linkedParentJID": null
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `404` session not found · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId

Get detailed group info including participants.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                              |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID                               |
| groupId   | string | Group ID, e.g. `120363021234567890@g.us` |

**Response** `200`

Raw object (no envelope). `engine.getGroupInfo()` returns `GroupInfo | null`; the service throws `404` when it is `null`.

```json
{
  "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
  "name": "Project Team",
  "description": "Internal coordination group.",

  ]
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `404` `Group <groupId> not found` · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/picture

Get the group's picture URL.

**Auth:** API key

**Response** `200` — `{ "url": "https://…" }`, or `{ "url": null }` when the group has no picture or
it is hidden by privacy settings.

**Errors:** `400` the id does not name a group, or the session is not active · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` engine not ready · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget — nothing could be read

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/picture

Set the group's picture. The account must be a group admin.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Request body** — `SetGroupPictureDto` (same shape as the profile-picture body)

| Field    | Type   | Required          | Constraints          | Description                                |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| url      | string | One of url/base64 | http(s) URL          | Fetched server-side through the SSRF guard |
| base64   | string | One of url/base64 | —                    | Wins over `url` when both are present      |
| mimetype | string | With `base64`     | must match `image/*` | Defaults to `image/jpeg`                   |

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Group picture updated" }`

**Errors:** `400` the id does not name a group, the session is not active, or neither `url` nor `base64` was supplied · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the engine refused (admin rights required) · `404` no such group · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `413` base64 media over the media cap (see §6.3) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget — the change may or may not have been applied

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/picture

Remove the group's picture. The account must be a group admin.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Group picture removed" }`

**Errors:** `400` the id does not name a group, or the session is not active · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the engine refused (admin rights required) · `404` no such group · `409` the session is not connected (engine exists but is not `ready`) · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget — the change may or may not have been applied

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| sessionId | string | Session ID  |

**Request body** — `CreateGroupDto`

| Field        | Type     | Required | Constraints                                                        | Description                                               |

| name         | string   | Yes      | `@IsString`, `@IsNotEmpty`, 1..100 chars                           | Group subject/name                                        |
| participants | string[] | Yes      | `@IsArray`, `@ArrayNotEmpty`, `@IsString({each:true})`, 1..256 ids | Non-empty array of WhatsApp IDs, e.g. `628123456789@c.us` |

```json
{
  "name": "Project Team",
  "participants": ["628123456789@c.us", "628987654321@c.us"]
}
```

**Response** `201`

Returns the created `Group` directly (raw).

```json
{
  "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
  "name": "Project Team",
  "participantsCount": 3,
  "isAdmin": true,
  "linkedParentJID": null
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (missing/empty `name` or `participants`, or any non-DTO field) / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` not supported on the active engine

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/participants

Add participants to a group.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Request body** — `ParticipantsDto`

| Field        | Type     | Required | Constraints                                            | Description                     |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| participants | string[] | Yes      | `@IsArray`, `@ArrayNotEmpty`, `@IsString({each:true})` | Non-empty array of WhatsApp IDs |

```json
{ "participants": ["628123456789@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `200`

Status is forced to `200` via `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)` (overriding the POST default). `results` carries the engine's per-participant outcome — a partial refusal does **not** fail the batch, so check `results[].success` rather than the envelope's `success`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Participants added",
  "results": [
    { "id": "628123456789@c.us", "success": true, "status": 200 },
    { "id": "628987654321@c.us", "success": false, "status": 403, "message": "invite-only" }
  ]
}
```

Each entry is a `ParticipantOperationResult`: `id` (the participant the outcome belongs to), `success` (true only when the engine confirmed the change for that participant), and the optional engine-reported `status`/`message` (e.g. `200` ok, `403` invite-only/not-admin, `404` not registered, `409` already a member). Engines that only confirm the batch as a whole report one success entry per requested participant.

**Errors:** `400` validation / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/participants

```json
{ "participants": ["628123456789@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `200`

No `@HttpCode`, so NestJS uses the DELETE default of `200`. `results` carries the per-participant outcome (see the add route above).

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Participants removed",
  "results": [{ "id": "628123456789@c.us", "success": true, "status": 200 }]

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/invite-code/revoke

Revoke the current invite code and generate a new one.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Request body** — none (send an empty body).

**Response** `200` (forced via `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)`)

`inviteCode` is the **new** code from `engine.revokeGroupInviteCode()`; `inviteLink` is `https://chat.whatsapp.com/<newCode>`.

```json
{
  "inviteCode": "XyZ987654321",
  "inviteLink": "https://chat.whatsapp.com/XyZ987654321",
  "message": "Invite code revoked and new one generated"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/join-info

Preview a group from its invite code, **without joining**. Supported on both engines.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped

Read-only — nothing about the account's membership changes, which is what makes it safe to call on a
code from an untrusted source, and what makes it the natural step before `POST /groups/join`.

**Query parameters**

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                        |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `code` | string | Yes      | Group invite code — the part after the invite link |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "120363012345678901@g.us",
  "name": "Product team",
  "description": "Internal coordination",
  "owner": "628123456789@c.us",
  "createdAt": 1700000000,
  "participantCount": 42
}
```

There is **no participant list** — the account is not a member — only `participantCount`, and only
when WhatsApp discloses one. `id` and `name` are always present; every other field is **omitted**
rather than zeroed when the engine did not report it, because `whatsapp-web.js` returns an untyped
object with no guaranteed shape and a defaulted `createdAt: 0` would read as "created at the epoch".

**Errors:** `400` no code supplied, or session not started · `401` · `404` no such invite — invalid, expired, or revoked · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/join

Join a group via an invite code (the part after `https://chat.whatsapp.com/`).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |

**Request body** — `JoinGroupDto`

| Field      | Type   | Required | Constraints | Description       |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| inviteCode | string | Yes      | non-empty   | Group invite code |

```json
{ "inviteCode": "XyZ987654321" }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "groupId": "120363000000000000@g.us" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / invalid invite code · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/settings

Read the group's admin-only settings and disappearing-message timer.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Response** `200`

`announce` = only admins can send messages; `locked` = only admins can edit group info. `ephemeralSeconds` and `memberAddMode` are each present only when the engine reports them.

```json
{ "announce": false, "locked": false, "ephemeralSeconds": 604800, "memberAddMode": "all" }
```

`memberAddMode` is `"all"` (any member may add participants) or `"admins"`. Both engines report and
accept it, but they encode it differently underneath — Baileys as a boolean where `true` means
_everyone_, whatsapp-web.js as WhatsApp's own `all_member_add`/`admin_add` strings (its typings claim
a boolean with the opposite sense). The adapters normalise both to these two values.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `404` group not found · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/settings

Update group settings. Each present field maps to one engine call; absent fields stay untouched. The caller must be a group admin for the change to take effect.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Request body** — `GroupSettingsDto` (at least one field required)

| Field            | Type    | Required | Constraints       | Description                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| announce         | boolean | No       | boolean           | Only admins can send messages                                                                          |
| locked           | boolean | No       | boolean           | Only admins can edit group info                                                                        |
| ephemeralSeconds | integer | No       | ≥ 0               | Disappearing-message timer in seconds (`0` disables). **Baileys only** — whatsapp-web.js returns `501` |
| memberAddMode    | string  | No       | `all` \| `admins` | Who may add participants. Supported on both engines                                                    |

```json
{ "announce": true, "ephemeralSeconds": 86400 }
```

> **Ordering within a patch is deliberate.** `ephemeralSeconds` is applied first because it is the
> only field with a deterministic per-engine refusal (whatsapp-web.js always `501`s it); applying
> anything else first would leave a half-applied patch behind when that call throws. `memberAddMode`
> is supported on both engines and is therefore applied after it.

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Group settings updated" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / empty patch / unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the account is not a group admin (`memberAddMode` on whatsapp-web.js) · `501` `ephemeralSeconds` on the whatsapp-web.js engine (library limitation) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/membership-requests

List the pending join requests of a group with join-approval mode turned on — the queue the
`group.join_request` webhook/socket event announces. Admin-only on both engines: a non-admin read
is refused by WhatsApp, not silently emptied.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Response** `200` — a bare array; fields the engine does not report are omitted rather than defaulted.

```json
[
  {
    "participantId": "628123456789@c.us",
    "addedById": "628987654321@c.us",
    "method": "invite_link",
    "requestedAt": 1754700000
  }
]
```

Each entry is a `GroupMembershipRequest`: `participantId` (the user asking to join), optional
`addedById` (who created the request — differs from the requester on a non-admin add), optional
`method` (`invite_link` | `non_admin_add` | `linked_group_join`), optional `requestedAt` (unix
seconds).

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` the engine refused the read — admin rights required · `409` engine not ready · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/membership-requests/approve

Approve pending join requests — the named requesters, or **every** pending request when the body
names none. Approving an empty queue is a no-op that returns an empty `results` list. Deliberately
not paced by the cold-reachout governor: unlike `POST .../participants`, the people here asked for
the contact themselves. On whatsapp-web.js the engine pauses 250–500ms between requesters
(upstream anti-abuse pacing), so acting on a large queue is a proportionally long request.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| groupId   | string | Group ID    |

**Request body** — `MembershipRequestActionDto`

| Field        | Type     | Required | Constraints                                                           | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| participants | string[] | No       | `@IsOptional`, `@IsArray`, `@ArrayNotEmpty`, `@IsString({each:true})` | Requester WhatsApp IDs. Omit to act on every pending request. |

```json
{ "participants": ["628123456789@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `200`

Status is forced to `200` via `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)` (overriding the POST default). `results`
carries the engine's per-participant outcome — the same `ParticipantOperationResult` contract as
the participant writes: a partial refusal does **not** fail the batch, while a batch that failed
for every **named** requester is a `403`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Membership requests approved",
  "results": [{ "id": "628123456789@c.us", "success": true, "status": 200 }]
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the engine refused (admin rights / every named requester failed) · `409` engine not ready · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/membership-requests/reject

Reject pending join requests. Same body, response shape, batch-guard contract and error map as
`.../membership-requests/approve`; rejecting an empty queue is likewise a no-op.

**Errors:** `400` validation / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role, or the engine refused (admin rights / every named requester failed) · `409` engine not ready · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Membership requests rejected",
  "results": [{ "id": "628123456789@c.us", "success": true, "status": 200 }]
}
```

### 6.4.5 Message Templates

Reusable message templates scoped to a session, with `{{variable}}` placeholders rendered at send time. All routes are nested under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/templates` and require an **OPERATOR** key. The `sessionId` is stored on the template but is **not** validated against an existing session in these handlers.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates

List all templates for a session, newest first.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; filters templates by `sessionId`. |

**Response** `200`

Bare `Template[]` array (no pagination, no envelope). Ordered by `createdAt` DESC. Returns an empty array — not `404` — when the session has no templates.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
    "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
    "name": "order-confirmation",
    "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
    "header": "OpenWA Store",
    "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe.",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

Get a single template by ID within the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; combined with `id` in the lookup. |
| id        | string | Template UUID.                                |

**Response** `200`

Raw `Template` entity (no envelope).

```json
{
  "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
  "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",

  "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `404` no row matches the `id`+`sessionId` pair (`{ "statusCode": 404, "message": "Template with id '<id>' not found", "error": "Not Found" }`)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates

Create a message template for the session (with `{{variable}}` placeholders in the body).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; stored as `template.sessionId`. Not validated against an existing session in this handler. |

**Request body** — `CreateTemplateDto`

| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name   | string | yes      | non-empty, max 100 chars  | Unique template name within the session (DB unique index on `[sessionId, name]`). Duplicate → `409`. |
| body   | string | yes      | non-empty, max 4096 chars | Template body containing `{{variable}}` placeholders rendered at send time.                          |
| header | string | no       | max 1024 chars            | Optional header text; coerced to `null` when omitted. Prepended to rendered body.                    |
| footer | string | no       | max 1024 chars            | Optional footer text; coerced to `null` when omitted. Appended to rendered body.                     |

```json
{
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",
  "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe."
}
```

**Response** `201`

Returns the saved `Template` entity raw (no envelope). The lazy `session` relation is not loaded on a freshly saved entity, so it is absent from the JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",

  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (missing/empty `name`/`body`, over-length, or any extra field rejected by `forbidNonWhitelisted`) · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `409` duplicate `name` for the session

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

| header | string | no       | max 1024 chars                        | Applied only when not `undefined`. The update path does **not** coerce to `null`, so passing explicit `null` fails `@IsString`; omit the key to leave it unchanged. |

```json
{
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} is out for delivery.",
  "footer": "Thanks for shopping with us."
}
```

**Response** `200`

Loads via lookup (`404` if missing), patches the provided fields, saves, and returns the updated entity raw. `updatedAt` is refreshed.

```json

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

Delete a template by ID.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description              |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| sessionId | string | Session ID.              |
| id        | string | Template UUID to delete. |

**Response** `204`

No content (empty body). The handler looks the template up first, so a missing template yields `404` rather than a silent `204`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `404` `id`+`sessionId` not found

### 6.4.6 Catalog & Channels

WhatsApp Business catalog browsing/sending and channel (newsletter) operations. Catalog read routes (`/catalog…`) require any valid API key; the two product/catalog **send** routes live under the `/messages` path and require an **OPERATOR** key. Channel read routes require any valid API key; subscribe/unsubscribe require **OPERATOR**.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog

Get business catalog info for the session's WhatsApp Business account.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description          |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890123456",
  "name": "My Storefront",
  "description": "Best products in town",
  "productCount": 12,
  "url": "https://wa.me/c/6281234567890"
}
```

**Baileys engine only.** whatsapp-web.js has no native Catalog API (the former null-returning stub was removed) and answers `501`; its readiness guard runs first, so a session that exists but is not `READY` (initializing, waiting on a QR, reconnecting) gets `409` instead. Baileys returns the catalog synthesized from its first collection; a business without collections has no catalog to describe and the route answers `200` with an empty body. WhatsApp does not always answer the underlying `w:biz:catalog` query for a business account: when the server stays silent (the socket is healthy and other queries reply) the request spends its budget and answers `503`. That is a WhatsApp-side limitation for the affected account, not a transient a retry clears, so a `503` here can be permanent.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY · `501` whatsapp-web.js only (no Catalog API) · `503` the catalog query went unanswered by WhatsApp, or the session/dependency is not ready (retryable only in the not-ready case; a silently unanswered catalog query does not clear on retry)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog/products

List catalog products with pagination.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description          |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Query parameters**

| Name    | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                             |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`  | integer | No       | `1`     | Page number. Coerced from string; must be an integer `>= 1` or `400`.   |
| `limit` | integer | No       | `20`    | Page size. Must be an integer `>= 1`. No upper cap declared on the DTO. |

Validated against `ProductQueryDto` via the global ValidationPipe; any unknown query key is rejected with `400` (forbidNonWhitelisted).

**Response** `200`

  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 1, "totalPages": 1 }

```

**Baileys engine only.** whatsapp-web.js answers `501` (its readiness guard runs first, so a session that exists but is not `READY` gets `409` instead). Baileys pages the products with a cursor; query validation still runs first, so a bad `page`/`limit` is a `400`.

**Errors:** `400` invalid `page`/`limit` or unknown query key · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY · `501` whatsapp-web.js only (no Catalog API) · `503` the catalog query went unanswered by WhatsApp, or the session/dependency is not ready (retryable only in the not-ready case; a silently unanswered catalog query does not clear on retry)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog/products/:productId

Get a specific catalog product by id.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description          |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |
| `productId` | string | Catalog product id.  |

**Response** `200`

```json

}
```

**Baileys engine only.** whatsapp-web.js answers `501` (readiness-guarded as above). Baileys resolves the product from the session catalog; an id no product carries answers `200` with an empty body.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY · `501` whatsapp-web.js only (no Catalog API) · `503` the catalog query went unanswered by WhatsApp, or the session/dependency is not ready (retryable only in the not-ready case; a silently unanswered catalog query does not clear on retry)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-product

Send a product message (catalog product card) to a chat. Note: this route lives under the `/messages` path but belongs to the catalog module.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description          |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Request body** — `SendProductDto`

| Field       | Type   | Required | Constraints | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chatId`    | string | Yes      | `@IsString` | Target chat/recipient id (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`). |
| `productId` | string | Yes      | `@IsString` | Catalog product id to send.                           |
| `body`      | string | No       | `@IsString` | Optional message body/caption.                        |

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "productId": "PROD_12345",
  "body": "Check out this item!"
}
```

**Response** `201` (Baileys engine only) — the sent `MessageResult`

**Errors:** `400` invalid chatId/productId, or session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` product not found in the session catalog · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` whatsapp-web.js only (no Catalog API) · `503` the catalog query went unanswered by WhatsApp, or the session/dependency is not ready (retryable only in the not-ready case; a silently unanswered catalog query does not clear on retry)

On whatsapp-web.js the readiness guard runs before the refusal, so a session that exists but is not
`READY` gets `409` instead of `501`. Baileys resolves the product from the session catalog and sends
the single-product message; an id with no catalog row is a `404` before anything is sent.

**Errors:** `400` missing `chatId`/`productId`, wrong types, or any field not on the DTO · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY · `500` engine error · `501` whatsapp-web.js only (no Catalog API) · `503` the catalog query went unanswered by WhatsApp, or the session/dependency is not ready (retryable only in the not-ready case; a silently unanswered catalog query does not clear on retry)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels

List all channels/newsletters the session is subscribed to.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

    "inviteCode": "ABC123xyz",
    "subscriberCount": 1042,
    "verified": true
  }
]
```

Bare array, no envelope. Only the whatsapp-web.js engine serves this route, and its channel mapping
fills neither `picture` nor `createdAt`, so neither field appears here even though the channel schema
declares them.

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` not supported on the active engine

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId

Get a single channel/newsletter by its id.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. Engine must be started. |
| `channelId` | string | Channel/newsletter id.                       |

**Response** `200`

```json

}
```

> **`picture` and `createdAt` are Baileys-only, and the lookup reaches further there.** The
> whatsapp-web.js engine exposes no per-id channel lookup, so the adapter scans the subscribed-channel
> list: a channel the account does not follow answers `404` even though it exists, and those two

> both.

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Channel <channelId> not found` (engine returned null; on whatsapp-web.js this includes a channel the account does not follow) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/messages

Get recent messages from a channel/newsletter.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

There is **no** DTO/ValidationPipe on this value, but a non-numeric `limit` (e.g. `?limit=abc`) parses to `NaN` and falls back to `undefined`, i.e. the engine default — it is never forwarded as `NaN`. |

    "hasMedia": false,
    "mediaUrl": null
  }
]
```

Bare array. `timestamp` is an epoch number (seconds).

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` not supported on the active engine

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels

Create a channel. Supported on **both** engines.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

The account becomes the channel's owner, which is what makes deleting it possible later — neither
engine can delete a channel it does not own.

**Request body** — `CreateChannelDto`

| Field         | Type   | Required | Constraints  | Description         |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `name`        | string | Yes      | 1–100 chars  | Channel name        |
| `description` | string | No       | ≤ 2048 chars | Channel description |

**Response** `201` — the created `Channel`, including its `inviteCode` (the code, not the full
`https://whatsapp.com/channel/…` link — the code is what `POST /channels/subscribe` takes).

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` the engine refused (on whatsapp-web.js this includes channel creation being disabled for the account) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/delete

Delete a channel this account owns. Supported on **both** engines.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

Irreversible, and every subscriber loses the channel.

> **Why not `DELETE /channels/:channelId`?** That route already exists and means _unsubscribe_.
> Leaving a channel and destroying it are very different acts, and they must not be reachable by the
> same request with one wrong verb — so deletion takes an explicit path, matching the
> `POST .../messages/delete` and `POST .../chats/delete` convention used elsewhere.

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` session not started · `401` · `403` the engine refused (not found, or this account does not own it) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/mute

Mute or unmute a channel. Supported on **both** engines.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

Silences the channel's notifications for this account. The subscription is untouched — this is not a
soft unsubscribe.

**Request body** — `MuteChannelDto`

| Field  | Type    | Required | Description                   |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `mute` | boolean | Yes      | `true` mutes, `false` unmutes |

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` the engine refused · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/admins/demote

Demote a channel admin back to a plain subscriber. **Baileys only** — the whatsapp-web.js engine
answers `501`.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

Requires this account to own the channel. There is **no promote counterpart**, and that is an
upstream limit rather than a gap here: neither engine library exposes one, so an admin is promoted
from the WhatsApp app and can then be demoted through this endpoint.

`whatsapp-web.js` declares `Client.demoteChannelAdmin`, but its page body calls a WhatsApp Web
module (`WAWebDemoteNewsletterAdminAction`) that no longer exports the function, so every call
fails. Rather than ship a route that always errors on that engine, it answers `501` there.

**Request body** — `DemoteChannelAdminDto`

| Field    | Type   | Required | Description                                  |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `userId` | string | Yes      | WhatsApp ID of the admin, e.g. `628xxx@c.us` |

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` the engine refused (not the owner, or the user is not an admin) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` the whatsapp-web.js engine cannot perform this · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/owner/transfer

Hand a channel this account owns to a new owner. **Baileys only** — the whatsapp-web.js engine
answers `501`.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

> **Irreversible.** Once the transfer lands, this session is no longer the owner and cannot take the
> channel back through this API.

The upstream option to also dismiss yourself as an admin in the same call is **not exposed**: the
WhatsApp Web function it depends on no longer exists, and it sits inside a branch that swallows its
own errors, so it would fail silently instead of refusing.

`whatsapp-web.js` declares `Client.transferChannelOwnership` and its page function is present, but on
current WhatsApp Web it rejects every call **locally** — measured at 4-9ms against a 352-531ms
known-server baseline in the same page — against a subscriber list the library has no working path to
repopulate. Rather than ship a route that always fails on that engine, it answers `501` there.

**Request body** — `TransferChannelOwnershipDto`

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `newOwnerId` | string | Yes      | WhatsApp ID of the new owner, e.g. `628xxx@c.us` |

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started · `401` · `403` WhatsApp refused the transfer · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` the whatsapp-web.js engine cannot perform this · `503` WhatsApp did not answer within the request budget, and the transfer may or may not have applied

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/subscribe

Subscribe to a channel using its invite code.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. Engine must be started. |

**Request body** — `SubscribeChannelDto`

| Field        | Type   | Required | Constraints               | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `inviteCode` | string | Yes      | `@IsString` `@IsNotEmpty` | Channel invite code from the channel share link. |

```json
{ "inviteCode": "ABC123xyz" }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "id": "120363000000000000@newsletter",
  "name": "OpenWA Updates",
  "description": "Release notes and tips",
  "inviteCode": "ABC123xyz",
  "subscriberCount": 1042,
  "picture": "https://example.com/ch.jpg",
  "verified": true,
  "createdAt": 1717200000
}
```

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started`, missing/empty `inviteCode`, or any unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `501` not supported on the active engine · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId

Unsubscribe from a channel.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. Engine must be started. |
| `channelId` | string | Channel id to unsubscribe from.              |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

Note: this is the one route in the module that returns a literal `{ success: true }` (hard-coded by the controller after the void engine call resolves) rather than the raw engine return. There is no `@HttpCode` override, so it returns `200`, not `204`.

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

### 6.4.7 Labels & Status

Labels are a WhatsApp Business feature: every label route lives under a session and reads/writes the chat-label assignments exposed by the engine. Status routes manage the session's status feed (stories) — reading visible statuses and posting/deleting your own. Read routes require a base API key; all writes require `OPERATOR`.

**The two engines split cleanly down the middle here, and neither covers both halves.**

|                                                                                                   | whatsapp-web.js                                  | Baileys                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Read labels (`GET /labels`, `/labels/:labelId`, `/labels/chat/:chatId`, `/labels/:labelId/chats`) | ✅                                               | `501` — exposes no label query at all |
| Edit labels (`PUT`/`DELETE /labels/:labelId`)                                                     | `501` — can read and assign, but cannot edit one | ✅                                    |
| Assign to a chat (`POST`/`DELETE /labels/chat/…`)                                                 | ✅                                               | ✅                                    |

So a deployment can read labels or edit them, depending on the engine, but not both. Assignment is
the only part that works everywhere. This is a library split, not a gateway one — see
`docs/29-engine-capability-matrix.md` for the symbols behind each cell.

**Creating a label means choosing its id.** WhatsApp carries a single write keyed on the label id, so
create and update are the same operation and there is no server-assigned id to hand back — which is
why the route is `PUT /labels/:labelId` rather than `POST /labels`. Reusing an existing id **rewrites
that label** instead of failing, because the protocol has no create-only form.

**Reads are store-backed, not engine-direct.** `GET /status` and `GET /status/:id` no longer call the engine — they read from an OpenWA-side store that ingests inbound status/story broadcasts as they arrive (plus a best-effort backfill of currently-active stories on session connect), with a 24h TTL matching WhatsApp's own story expiry. This makes reads **identical on both engines**: `whatsapp-web.js` (which had a native `getBroadcasts()`/`getBroadcastById()` path) and Baileys (which never had one — `fetchStatus` only returns the _about_ text, not stories, so the raw engine methods still throw `501` if called directly, they're just no longer on the read path) now return the same shape from the same source. A status older than 24h, or received before the store existed, will not appear.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels

List all labels defined for the session (WhatsApp Business accounts only).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  { "id": "1", "name": "New customer", "hexColor": "#FF9485" },
  { "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }
]
```

Bare array — raw return of `engine.getLabels()`; no envelope.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started (no live engine), or the account is not a WhatsApp Business account · `401` missing/invalid API key · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-read (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/:labelId

Get a single label by its ID.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID  |
| labelId   | string | Label ID    |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }
```

The engine resolves `Label | null`; a `null` is mapped to `404` in the service, so a `200` always carries a label.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Label <labelId> not found` · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-read (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/:labelId/chats

Every chat carrying a label.

**Auth:** API key · **Scope:** session-scoped · **Engines:** whatsapp-web.js only

**Response** `200` — a bare array of `ChatSummary`, the same shape `GET /sessions/:sessionId/chats` returns.

**Errors:** `400` session not started (also when the session does not exist) · `401` · `404` label or chat not found · `501` Baileys, which has no label query · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/:labelId

Create or update a label.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped · **Engines:** Baileys only

The label id is **yours to choose** and travels in the path. Whether this creates or updates depends
only on whether that id already exists — reusing one rewrites that label rather than failing.
Omitted fields are left as they are.

**Request body** — `UpsertLabelDto`

| Field   | Type   | Required | Constraints  | Description                                  |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `name`  | string | No       | 1–100 chars  | Omit to keep the current name                |
| `color` | number | No       | integer 0–19 | WhatsApp's colour **index**, not a hex value |

`color` deliberately does not round-trip with the `hexColor` the read routes return: neither engine
exposes the index-to-hex mapping — whatsapp-web.js passes hex through from the WA Web store and
Baileys only ever speaks in indices — so translating between them here would be guesswork that
silently sets the wrong colour.

```json
{ "name": "VIP customer", "color": 3 }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Errors:** `400` validation, or session not started (also when the session does not exist) · `401` · `403` · `501` whatsapp-web.js, which cannot edit labels · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/:labelId

Delete a label. It disappears from every chat it was on.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped · **Engines:** Baileys only

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Errors:** `400` session not started (also when the session does not exist) · `401` · `403` · `501` whatsapp-web.js, which cannot edit labels · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId

List the labels currently assigned to a specific chat.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID                                              |
| chatId    | string | Chat ID (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us` or a group `…@g.us`) |

**Response** `200`

```json
[{ "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }]
```

Bare array — raw return of `engine.getChatLabels(chatId)`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-read (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId

Add a label to a chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description      |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID       |
| chatId    | string | Chat ID to label |

**Request body** — `AddLabelDto`

| Field   | Type   | Required | Constraints      | Description                 |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| labelId | string | yes      | non-empty string | Label ID to add to the chat |

```json
{ "labelId": "5" }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The handler always returns the literal `{ "success": true }`.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (missing/empty/non-string `labelId`, or any unknown body field — strict whitelist), or session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `422` labels require a WhatsApp Business account, or the chat type has no labels · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId/:labelId

Remove a label from a chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description        |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| sessionId | string | Session ID         |
| chatId    | string | Chat ID            |
| labelId   | string | Label ID to remove |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The handler always returns `{ "success": true }`. DELETE default status is `200` (no `@HttpCode` override).

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `422` labels require a WhatsApp Business account, or the chat type has no labels · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status

Get all contact status updates (stories) visible to the session, read from the store (24h TTL, both engines — see the note above).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "id": "false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F...",
      "contact": { "id": "6281234567890@c.us", "name": "Alice", "pushName": "Alice" },
      "type": "image",
      "caption": "On the road",
      "mediaUrl": "/api/sessions/my-session/status/false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F.../media",
      "backgroundColor": "#25D366",
      "font": 2,
      "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The controller wraps the store array in `{ statuses }`, ordered newest-first. `type` is one of `text | image | video | voice` (`voice` was added with the send-voice endpoint below; before that anything that was not an image or a video read back as `text`); `caption`, `backgroundColor`, `font` are optional. `mediaUrl` is present only when the status carried media that the store kept (see the media endpoint below) — it is a same-origin path into this API, not an external WhatsApp CDN link. `timestamp` and `expiresAt` serialize to ISO strings (these are `Date` values, not the epoch-number convention used by message timestamps).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:id

Get status updates posted by a specific contact, read from the store (24h TTL, both engines).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier                |
| contactId | string | Contact JID/id (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`) |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "id": "false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F...",
      "contact": { "id": "6281234567890@c.us", "pushName": "Alice" },
      "type": "text",
      "caption": "Hello!",
      "backgroundColor": "#25D366",
      "font": 0,
      "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Same `{ statuses }` wrapper and `Status` shape as the list-all route. An unknown `contactId` returns `{ "statuses": [] }`, not a `404`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:statusId/media

Stream a stored status's media bytes (the file behind a `mediaUrl` returned above).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                          |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier                          |
| statusId  | string | The status `id` (e.g. from a `GET /status` response) |

**Response** `200` — the raw media bytes as the response body, served as an **attachment** (`Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`). `Content-Type` is the stored mimetype when it belongs to the image/video/audio families — except `image/svg+xml` in any parameterized or whitespace-padded form, which is scriptable despite the `image/` prefix — and `application/octet-stream` otherwise, so no stored status media is ever served as active content on the API origin. Streamed via `StreamableFile` from whatever backs `StorageService` (local disk or S3 — the route does not care which).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` `Status media not found or expired` — the status is text-only, its media was omitted (e.g. over the configured size cap), or the 24h TTL has since purged the row

Note: `:statusId/media` is a two-path-segment route, so it never collides with the single-segment `GET /status/:id` above regardless of declaration order.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-text

Post a text status (story) to the session's status feed. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Request body** — `SendTextStatusDto`

| Field           | Type     | Required | Constraints                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| backgroundColor | string   | no       | 6-digit hex color matching `^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$`                       | e.g. `#25D366`; bad value → `backgroundColor must be a hex color (e.g., #25D366)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| font            | integer  | no       | `@IsIn([0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` — `3`–`5` are rejected with `400` | WhatsApp status font index: `0` (default), `1`, `2`, `6` (bold), `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`. whatsapp-web.js honors only `0`–`7` and clamps anything above back to the default                                                                                                                                                   |

```json
{ "text": "Hello from OpenWA!", "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"], "backgroundColor": "#25D366", "font": 2 }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "statusId": "false_status@broadcast_3A1F...",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly (no wrapper). POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — WhatsApp may not deliver to an unresolved LID, so prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known.

**Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may display a "waiting for this status update" notice in its status feed; this is cosmetic — recipients view the status normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, `text` over 4096 chars, bad `backgroundColor`/`font`) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-image

Post an image status (story) from a URL or base64 payload. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

The service resolves the media as `image.base64 || image.url || ''` — `base64` wins when both are supplied — and applies mimetype `image.mimetype ?? 'image/jpeg'`.

```json

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly. POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known. **Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may show a "waiting for this status update" notice; recipients view it normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, an empty media wrapper, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, or a caption over 1024 chars) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `413` payload too large

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-video

Post a video status (story) from a URL or base64 payload. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

The service resolves the media as `video.base64 || video.url || ''` — `base64` wins when both are supplied — and applies mimetype `video.mimetype ?? 'video/mp4'`.

```json
{
  "video": { "url": "https://example.com/clip.mp4", "mimetype": "video/quicktime" },
  "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"],
  "caption": "Watch this"
}
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "statusId": "false_status@broadcast_3A1F...",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly. POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known. **Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may show a "waiting for this status update" notice; recipients view it normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, an empty media wrapper, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, or a caption over 1024 chars) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `413` payload too large

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-voice

Post an audio status (story) as a **voice note**, from a URL or base64 payload. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

> **Format matters.** WhatsApp plays a status voice note only when it is Ogg/Opus, and neither engine transcodes — bytes are sent as supplied. Convert first via `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/media/convert/voice` (§6.4.15) and post the `base64` it returns. Sending another format produces a bubble that will not play.

```json
{ "audio": { "base64": "T2dnUwACAAAA..." }, "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `201` — the engine `StatusResult`, identical in shape to the image/video variants.

**Read-back:** a voice status is listed with `"type": "voice"`. That member was added with this endpoint; before it, anything that was not an image or a video was reported as `text`.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure, or neither `url` nor `base64` supplied · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected · `413` base64 media exceeds `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:id

Delete one of the session's own posted statuses.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                             |

| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier                                             |
| statusId  | string | Id of the status to delete (the `statusId` returned by a `send-*` call) |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "message": "Status deleted successfully" }
```

The service returns `void`; the controller returns a fixed success object. DELETE default status is `200`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` `Session {id} not found or not connected` · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-request, so the revoke did not complete

Safe to retry: revoking an already-revoked status converges. The status POST routes deliberately do
NOT answer `503` for the same failure, because whatsapp-web.js can throw after the request is on the
wire and a client replaying on `503` would publish the status a second time. They answer an opaque
`500` there, exactly as the message sends do.

### 6.4.8 Webhooks (management)

Webhooks are configured per session and managed under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks` (handled by `WebhookController`). Two cross-session endpoints live on `WebhooksListController`: `GET /api/webhooks` (list, **OPERATOR**) and `GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures` (dead-letter log, **ADMIN**). Every other route requires an API key with **OPERATOR** role or higher.

Two fields — `secret` and `headers` — are **write-only**: they are accepted on create/update but are never returned by any webhook route (the response DTO has no `@Expose` for them, so `fromEntity` drops them). `GET /api/infra/export-data` also omits both from its `webhooks` rows, so a backup no longer carries webhook credentials — a restored webhook comes back unsigned (`secret` null, `headers` `{}`) until you set them again. The `secret` is used to compute the `X-OpenWA-Signature: sha256=<hex>` HMAC-SHA256 header on deliveries.

The `events` array accepts these members plus the `*` wildcard: `message.received`, `message.sent`, `message.ack`, `message.failed`, `message.revoked`, `message.reaction`, `message.edited`, `session.status`, `session.qr`, `session.authenticated`, `session.disconnected`, `session.reconnect_loop`, `session.restriction`, `presence.update`, `call.accepted`, `call.rejected`, `call.missed`, `group.join`, `group.leave`, `group.update`, `group.join_request`, `call.received`, `status.received`. All of them are actively dispatched by at least one engine — none is a reserved placeholder. Four are **Baileys only**, because whatsapp-web.js produces no callback behind them: `presence.update` (its prerequisite `POST .../presence/subscribe` answers `501` there, so this one announces itself) and `call.accepted` / `call.rejected` / `call.missed` (whatsapp-web.js sees a call ring but never its outcome, so these three are accepted on subscribe and then simply never fire). See the per-event catalog below for engine scope.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks

List all webhooks for a session, ordered by `createdAt` descending.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                       |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID to filter webhooks by. |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "sessionId": "my-session",

    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

Returns a bare array; empty array if the session has no webhooks. `secret` and `headers` are never included. Not paginated.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id

Get a single webhook by ID, scoped to the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string        | Session ID. The lookup is `WHERE { id, sessionId }`, so a webhook belonging to a different session resolves to `404` (no cross-session existence oracle). |
| id        | string (uuid) | Webhook ID.                                                                                                                                               |

**Response** `200`

```json

```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session (message `"Webhook with id '<id>' not found"`)

#### GET /api/webhooks

List webhooks visible to the calling API key, scoped to its allowed sessions.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped — derived from the authenticated key, not from any param/query

**Query parameters**

    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

Bare array, ordered by `createdAt` descending, bounded by `limit`/`offset`. If the calling key has a non-empty `allowedSessions` list, results are filtered to `WHERE sessionId IN (allowedSessions)`; a key with null/empty `allowedSessions` (e.g. an unrestricted ADMIN key) sees **all** webhooks. This is the cross-session list; the per-session list lives at `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role

#### GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures

List webhook deliveries that exhausted every retry, most recent first. This is the dead-letter trail referenced by §6.6 — a receiver outage longer than the retry window, an over-budget payload, or a blocked (SSRF-guarded) URL lands here instead of vanishing.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) · **Scope:** results are confined to the calling key's `allowedSessions`, so a session-restricted ADMIN key cannot read another session's rows via `sessionId`

**Query parameters**

| Name        | Type             | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                          |

| `sessionId` | string           | No       | —       | Narrow to one session. A value outside the key's `allowedSessions` returns `[]` (no cross-session existence oracle). |
| `limit`     | integer (1-1000) | No       | `1000`  | Max records to return; oversized/non-finite values are clamped/fallback to the default window.                       |
| `offset`    | integer          | No       | `0`     | Records to skip for paging; negative/non-finite values resolve to `0`.                                               |

Bare array of `WebhookDeliveryFailure` rows, ordered by `createdAt` descending. `lastStatusCode` is `null` when the failure was a network/timeout/SSRF error rather than a non-2xx response; `idempotencyKey`/`deliveryId` let you correlate the lost event with your own receiver logs.

Omit/null = fire on every subscribed event. Defaults to `null`. ⚠️ A condition whose field is DEFINED for the event family but absent from that event's payload cannot match, so it suppresses the event entirely (a field with no definition for the family is skipped instead, and does not suppress) — `message.ack`/`message.failed` carry `{ id, messageId, status, ack }` and `message.reaction` carries `{ messageId, chatId, reaction, senderId }`, none of which has a sender or body, so a `sender` filter silently drops all three.

**Request body** — `UpdateWebhookDto` (all fields optional; only fields where the value is not `undefined` are applied)

| Field      | Type                   | Required | Constraints                                                                                               | Description                                                                   |

  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the saved entity; `secret` and `headers` excluded.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure, unknown body field (whitelist), or URL rejection (SSRF guard, or embedded credentials in the URL) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id/test

Send a synthetic test payload to the webhook URL and report the result. No request body.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type          | Description                                                    |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string        | Session scope; looked up first → `404` if not in this session. |
| id        | string (uuid) | Webhook ID.                                                    |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "statusCode": 200 }
```

On a reachable endpoint the response is `{ success: <response.ok>, statusCode: <response.status> }` — so a non-2xx target returns `200` HTTP with `success: false` and the target's `statusCode`. On an SSRF/timeout/network error the response is `{ "success": false, "error": "<message>" }`. The endpoint never throws on delivery failure; the failure is reflected in the body, not the HTTP status. The test POST sends `{ "event": "test", ... }` with headers `Content-Type`, `User-Agent: OpenWA-Webhook/1.0.0`, `X-OpenWA-Event: test`, `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key`, `X-OpenWA-Delivery-Id`, `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count: 0`, and `X-OpenWA-Signature` when a secret is set. Timeout defaults to 10000 ms (`webhook.timeout` config).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id

Delete a webhook, scoped to the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type          | Description                                                    |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string        | Session scope; looked up first → `404` if not in this session. |
| id        | string (uuid) | Webhook ID.                                                    |

**Response** `204`

No content (empty body; explicit `@HttpCode(204)`).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

### 6.4.9 API Keys

API keys are managed under `/api/auth/api-keys`. All management routes (create/list/get/update/delete/revoke) require an **ADMIN** key **with no session scope**: the controller is fenced with `@RequireUnscopedKey`, so a key whose `allowedSessions` is non-empty is rejected with `403` whatever its role — otherwise a confined admin key could mint an unrestricted one. The guard evaluates the role requirement _before_ that fence, so a scoped VIEWER/OPERATOR key is refused with `Insufficient permissions. Required: admin`; only a scoped ADMIN key reaches the fence and sees `Session-scoped API keys are not permitted on this route`. Both are `403`. The plaintext key string is returned **only once**, at creation. Validation of the caller's own key lives at `POST /api/auth/validate` (a separate controller, not fenced) and accepts any valid key.

#### GET /api/auth/api-keys

List all API keys, newest first. The plaintext key is never returned.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

Bare JSON array (no envelope), ordered by `createdAt` DESC. Null array/date fields are omitted.

```json

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped

#### GET /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Get a single API key's details by id. No plaintext key.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

#### POST /api/auth/api-keys

Create a new API key; returns the full plaintext key exactly once.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `CreateApiKeyDto`

  "expiresAt": "2027-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Response** `201` — `ApiKeyCreatedResponseDto`

Same shape as the read DTO **plus** an `apiKey` field carrying the full plaintext key `owa_k1_<64 hex>`. This is the **only** time the plaintext key is returned. `keyPrefix` is the first 12 chars; `usageCount` starts at `0`, `isActive` is `true`. Null `allowedIps`/`allowedSessions`/`expiresAt`/`lastUsedAt` are omitted.

}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (bad `name` length, invalid `role` enum, non-IPv4 `allowedIps` entry, bad `expiresAt`, or any non-whitelisted body field) · `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped

#### PUT /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Update mutable fields of an API key. `isActive` is **not** updatable here — use the revoke route to deactivate.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (incl. `forbidNonWhitelisted` for unknown fields such as `isActive`) · `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` not found · `409` change would remove the last usable admin key

#### POST /api/auth/api-keys/:id/revoke

Revoke (deactivate) an API key without deleting it. No request body required.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type          | Description |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | API key id. |

**Response** `200` — `ApiKeyResponseDto`

Sets `isActive` to `false` and returns the key with explicit HTTP `200`. After revoke, the key fails validation with `401 "API key is revoked"`.

```json
{
  "id": "3f2a1c9e-1b2d-4a5f-9c8e-aa11bb22cc33",
  "name": "Production Bot",
  "keyPrefix": "owa_k1_a1b2",

  "isActive": false,
  "usageCount": 42,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` not found · `409` target is the last usable admin key

#### DELETE /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Permanently delete an API key (hard delete). Also drops any un-flushed usage accumulator.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type          | Description |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | API key id. |

**Response** `204`

`@HttpCode(204)` — no response body.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` `"API key with id '<id>' not found"` · `409` target is the last usable admin key

#### POST /api/auth/validate

Validate the supplied `X-API-Key` and report its validity and role.

**Auth:** API key (any valid role — VIEWER+)

The key is read from the `X-API-Key` header, not the body; send an empty body. This route sits behind the global guard (it is not `@Public`), so a missing/invalid/revoked/expired key is rejected with `401` at the guard before the handler runs. On success it returns the caller's role.

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "valid": true, "role": "operator" }
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid/revoked/expired key (raised by the global guard before the handler)

> Implemented by `AuthValidateController` (`@Controller('auth')`), sharing the same `/api/auth` base.

### 6.4.10 System (Health, Metrics, Stats, Settings, Audit)

System endpoints expose operational status, Prometheus metrics, aggregate statistics, runtime settings, and the audit log. Health and metrics use non-standard auth (public / Bearer token); stats, settings and audit use the API key, with several routes gated to `ADMIN`.

#### GET /api/health

Basic health check returning status and the current timestamp; the running app version is disclosed only to authenticated callers.

**Auth:** public — the check itself needs no credentials, so uptime probes keep working. The `version` field is added only when the request carries a valid API key (`X-API-Key` header or `Authorization: Bearer`); an absent or invalid key still answers `200` without it.

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T12:34:56.789Z", "version": "0.7.3" }
```

Notes: `timestamp` is an ISO-8601 string (`new Date().toISOString()`). `version` is read from `package.json` at module load and present only on an authenticated request. Exempt from rate limiting (`@SkipThrottle`).

#### GET /api/health/live

Kubernetes liveness probe — returns a deliberately static body reflecting only process liveness; it does NOT probe dependencies.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

Notes: always `{ "status": "ok" }`. Intentionally static so a transient dependency outage does not trigger a pod kill. The handler never returns a non-200.

#### GET /api/health/ready

Readiness probe — verifies the `main` (auth/audit) and `data` TypeORM datasources respond to `SELECT 1` (each bounded to a 3000 ms timeout) and reports `503` while the app is draining/shutting down.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "details": {
    "mainDatabase": { "status": "up" },
    "dataDatabase": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `503` — either datasource fails or exceeds its 3 s `SELECT 1` timeout, or the app is shutting down. The handler throws `ServiceUnavailableException`, so NestJS wraps the custom `{ status, details }` object as the `message` field:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 503,
  "message": {
    "status": "error",
    "details": { "mainDatabase": { "status": "up" }, "dataDatabase": { "status": "down" } }
  },
  "error": "Service Unavailable"
}
```

During shutdown the `details` instead read `{ "shutdown": { "status": "draining" } }`. Probes run in parallel via `Promise.all`. There is no `health/detailed` route.

#### GET /api/metrics

Prometheus exposition scrape of OpenWA process + session + message metrics; gated by a `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer (disabled when the token is unset).

**Auth:** Bearer METRICS_TOKEN — `Authorization: Bearer <METRICS_TOKEN>`. This route is `@Public()` (it bypasses the `X-API-Key` guard); access is instead validated inside the service with a constant-time compare. The `Bearer ` prefix is stripped case-insensitively. Hidden from Swagger.

**Response** `200`

Content-Type `text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. Raw text (no JSON envelope):

When the data database cannot be read the database-derived series (`openwa_sessions*`,
`openwa_messages*`) are OMITTED rather than reported as zero — a zero would fire an alert
claiming every session had dropped. `openwa_stats_available` is what tells the two cases apart,
so alert on it rather than reading a missing series as zero. `docs/10` lists every series.

openwa_messages_failed_total 4
```

Values come from `StatsService.getOverview()` plus `process.memoryUsage()`/`process.uptime()`. The render is memoized for 5000 ms to avoid re-running the overview query on every scrape.

**Errors:** `401` — `METRICS_TOKEN` is configured but the bearer is missing or does not match (`{ "statusCode": 401, "message": "Invalid metrics token", "error": "Unauthorized" }`) · `404` — `METRICS_TOKEN` is unset/blank, so the endpoint is disabled (`{ "statusCode": 404, "message": "Metrics endpoint is disabled (set METRICS_TOKEN to enable)", "error": "Not Found" }`).

#### GET /api/stats/overview

Get overall cross-session aggregate statistics (sessions by status + message totals + today's counts).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions — a global cross-tenant aggregate, so a session-scoped key has no claim on it and is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`).

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "active": 2,
    "total": 3,
    "byStatus": { "ready": 2, "disconnected": 1 }
  },
  "messages": {
    "sent": 1280,
    "received": 940,
    "failed": 4,
    "today": { "sent": 42, "received": 30 }
  }
}
```

Notes: raw handler return (no envelope). `sessions.byStatus` is keyed by the stored `SessionStatus` values — lowercase, per §6.4.1 — with per-status counts; `sessions.active` counts only `ready`. `messages.sent`/`received` are all-time outgoing/incoming COUNTs; `failed` is the `FAILED`-status COUNT; `today.*` are the same counts since local midnight. Side effect: caches the `sessions` block via `CacheService`.

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` — key role below `ADMIN`, or the key is session-restricted.

#### GET /api/stats/messages

Get message statistics over a period: time series, counts by type, by session, and top chats.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions — a cross-session aggregate, so a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`).

**Query parameters**

| Name     | Type                     | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `period` | `'24h' \| '7d' \| '30d'` | No       | `24h`   | Window for the report. `@IsIn(['24h','7d','30d'])` — any other value → `400`. Bucket interval is `hour` for `24h`, else `day`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "timeSeries": [
    { "timestamp": "2026-06-25 10:00:00", "sent": 12, "received": 8 },
    { "timestamp": "2026-06-25 11:00:00", "sent": 20, "received": 14 }
  ],
  "byType": { "chat": 180, "image": 24, "unknown": 3 },
  "bySession": [{ "sessionId": "9f1c…", "name": "support-line", "sent": 200, "received": 140 }],
  "topChats": [{ "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us", "messageCount": 320 }]
}
```

Notes: raw handler return. `timeSeries.timestamp` is a DB-formatted bucket string — hourly `YYYY-MM-DD HH:00:00` for `24h`, daily `YYYY-MM-DD` for `7d`/`30d` — sorted ascending. `byType` keys are message-type strings (a null type becomes `unknown`). `bySession.name` is `Unknown` when the session is not found. `topChats` is the top 10 by `messageCount` DESC. All counts are numbers.

**Errors:** `400` — `period` not in the enum, or any non-whitelisted query field (strict `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`) · `401` — missing/invalid API key · `403` — role below `ADMIN`, or the key is session-restricted.

#### GET /api/stats/sessions/:sessionId

Get statistics for a single session: identity, message counts, top chats, and 24 h hourly activity.

**Auth:** API key — any valid key (VIEWER and up); there is no `@RequireRole`. Scope still applies: the global guard feeds the `:sessionId` route param to the key's `allowedSessions`, so a session-scoped key asking for a session outside its list gets `401 "API key not authorized for this session"`. Only an unscoped key can read any session's stats.

**Path parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessionId` | string | Session entity id. No format validation; `404` if no session matches. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "session": { "id": "9f1c…", "name": "support-line", "status": "ready" },
  "messages": { "sent": 200, "received": 140, "today": 18, "failed": 1 },
  "topChats": [{ "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us", "count": 64, "lastActive": "2026-06-25 11:42:07" }],
  "hourlyActivity": [
    { "hour": 0, "sent": 0, "received": 0 },
    { "hour": 1, "sent": 3, "received": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Notes: raw handler return. `session.status` is the `SessionStatus` enum value. `messages.sent`/`received` are all-time outgoing/incoming COUNTs; `today` is the total message count since local midnight; `failed` is the `FAILED`-status count. `topChats` is the top 10 by count DESC, with `lastActive` = `MAX(createdAt)` as a DB-native datetime string. `hourlyActivity` always has 24 entries (hour `0..23`), missing hours zero-filled, computed over the last 24 h.

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid API key, or the key is not scoped to this session · `404` — session not found (`Session not found`).

#### GET /api/settings

Get application settings (environment-derived; `general`/`api`/`notifications` groups).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions. Settings describe the whole deployment, so the route requires an unrestricted key (`@RequireUnscopedKey`): the role check alone does not exclude a key confined to a subset of sessions, which has no claim on deployment-wide configuration, so a session-scoped ADMIN key is rejected with `403`. A key below `ADMIN` is also rejected with `403`.

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "general": {
    "apiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:2785",
    "autoReconnect": true,
    "debugMode": false
  },
  "api": {
    "rateLimit": 100,
    "rateLimitWindow": 60000,
    "enableDocs": true
  },
  "notifications": {
    "emailEnabled": false,
    "notificationEmail": "",
    "webhookAlerts": true
  }
}
```

Notes: raw return of an in-memory `Settings` object built once in the controller constructor from `ConfigService` (snapshotted at construction, not re-read per request). `api.rateLimitWindow` is in ms. `enableDocs` reflects the `ENABLE_SWAGGER` gate (enabled by default outside production; disabled by default in production unless explicitly enabled). Only `notifications.*` is currently hardcoded (`emailEnabled: false`, `notificationEmail: ''`, `webhookAlerts: true`).

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` — API key lacks the ADMIN role, or the key is session-restricted.

#### GET /api/audit

List audit-log entries, newest first. API-key lifecycle changes, session lifecycle events and ADMIN infra operations land here. **The six actions below are never emitted**: message sends and webhook deliveries are tracked in their own tables (`messages`, `webhook_delivery_failures`) — `webhook_created`/`webhook_deleted` are simply not wired yet — so filtering for `message_sent`, `message_failed`, `webhook_created`, `webhook_deleted`, `webhook_triggered` or `webhook_failed` returns zero rows by design.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) · **Scope:** rows are confined to the calling key's `allowedSessions` — the `sessionId` query may only narrow within that list, never widen it

**Query parameters**

| Name        | Type                          | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`    | string                        | No       | —       | Filter by `AuditAction` (e.g. `api_key_created`, `session_started`, `infra_data_imported`). Message/webhook actions are never emitted (see above). |
| `severity`  | `'info' \| 'warn' \| 'error'` | No       | —       | Filter by `AuditSeverity`.                                                                                                                         |
| `sessionId` | string                        | No       | —       | Narrow to one session. A value outside the key's `allowedSessions` returns `{ "data": [], "total": 0 }`.                                           |
| `apiKeyId`  | string                        | No       | —       | Filter by the acting key's id.                                                                                                                     |
| `limit`     | integer                       | No       | `50`    | Page size, clamped to a maximum of `200`.                                                                                                          |
| `offset`    | integer                       | No       | `0`     | Rows to skip; a negative value resolves to `0`.                                                                                                    |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "6b3f…",
      "action": "session_started",
      "severity": "info",
      "apiKeyId": "1c2d…",
      "apiKeyName": "dashboard",
      "sessionId": "9f1c…",
      "sessionName": "support-line",
      "ipAddress": "203.0.113.7",
      "userAgent": null,
      "method": null,
      "path": null,

      "metadata": null,
      "errorMessage": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-06-25T11:42:07.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Unlike the other list routes this one is **not** a bare array: `data` is the page and `total` the unpaginated match count. Nullable columns (`apiKeyId`, `sessionId`, `metadata`, `errorMessage`, …) are `null` when the event has no such dimension. `userAgent` and `statusCode` are reserved columns nothing populates, so rows carry `null`. `method` and `path` are populated only where an emitter passes them explicitly (API-key auth failures, key lifecycle changes, queue-board mutations); session/message-flow rows like the sample leave them `null`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below ADMIN

### 6.4.11 Administration (Infrastructure, Plugins, MCP)

Admin-facing operations: infrastructure status & config, the data/storage migration tooling, plugin lifecycle, and the optional MCP transport. Almost every route is **API key (ADMIN)**; the two exceptions are the public `GET /api/infra/health` and the `POST /mcp` JSON-RPC endpoint (see end of section).

> Note on the MCP request body: the entire `POST /mcp` envelope (mounted as a raw Express handler, outside the Nest pipe chain) is a **plain TS interface, not a class-validator DTO** — the global `whitelist`/`forbidNonWhitelisted` ValidationPipe does **not** run on it. Unknown fields pass through silently and no type/constraint checks happen, except the few field-level guards noted per endpoint. The infra bodies — `ImportDataDto` (`POST /api/infra/import-data`), `SaveConfigDto` (`PUT /api/infra/config`), `RestartDto` (`POST /api/infra/restart`), `ImportStorageDto` (`POST /api/infra/storage/import`) — and the plugin DTOs (`InstallFromUrlDto`, `PluginConfigDto`, `PluginSessionsDto`) _are_ class-validated and reject unknown fields with `400`. `ImportDataDto` additionally accepts, and ignores, the five metadata fields the export wraps `tables` in, so the backup file posts back unmodified.

---

#### GET /api/infra/health

Public liveness probe.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T12:00:00.000Z" }
```

---

#### GET /api/infra/status

Aggregate infrastructure status (database, Redis, queue, storage, engine).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "database": { "connected": true, "type": "sqlite", "host": "", "builtIn": false },
  "redis": { "enabled": false, "connected": false, "host": "localhost", "port": 6379, "builtIn": false },
  "queue": {
    "enabled": false,
    "webhooks": { "pending": 0, "completed": 0, "failed": 0 }
  },
  "storage": { "type": "local", "path": "./data/media", "builtIn": false },
  "engine": {
    "type": "whatsapp-web.js",
    "headless": true,
    "sessionDataPath": "./data/sessions",
    "browserArgs": "--no-sandbox --disable-gpu",
    "webVersion": "2.3000.1040641150-alpha",
    "webVersionSource": "auto"
  }
}
```

The `queue.webhooks` counters are live BullMQ job counts (`pending` = waiting + active + delayed; plus `completed`/`failed`), degrading to zeros when the queue is disabled or Redis is unreachable. `redis.connected` is a live probe.

`builtIn` (on `database`/`redis`/`storage`) reports whether OpenWA's own bundled container is actually running _and_ backing this service, detected live from the labelled container; when Docker is unreachable it falls back to the saved `*_BUILTIN` intent from `data/.env.generated`. In S3 mode `storage` additionally carries `bucket` (when one is configured) and `s3Available` (a throttled re-probe); in local mode neither key is present. `engine.webVersion`/`engine.webVersionSource` (`pinned` / `auto` / `native`) appear only on `whatsapp-web.js`; `webVersion` is `null` until the auto-resolve first succeeds.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role < ADMIN

---

#### GET /api/infra/engines

List available WhatsApp engine plugins.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — bare array

```json
[
  {
    "id": "whatsapp-web.js",
    "name": "WhatsApp Web.js",
    "enabled": true,
    "features": ["send", "receive", "media", "groups"],
    "library": { "name": "whatsapp-web.js", "version": "1.34.7" }
  }
]
```

`library` is optional and may be omitted per engine.

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/infra/engines/current

Get the currently active engine type.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "engineType": "whatsapp-web.js" }
```

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/infra/config

Read the effective infrastructure config used to hydrate the dashboard form. Each field resolves with the boot precedence: a value pinned by the host environment (e.g. Compose `environment:`) or the project `.env` wins over `data/.env.generated`, while a key that only ever lived in the saved file reports the freshly-saved value even before a restart applies it ("saved, pending restart"). **Secrets are never returned** — only `*Set`/`*CredentialsSet` booleans indicate that a secret is stored.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — `SavedConfigResponse`

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "sqlite",
    "builtIn": false,
    "host": "",
    "port": "",
    "username": "",
    "database": "",
    "schema": "public",
    "poolSize": 10,
    "sslEnabled": false,
    "sslRejectUnauthorized": true,
    "passwordSet": false
  },
  "redis": { "enabled": false, "builtIn": false, "host": "", "port": "", "passwordSet": false },
  "queue": { "enabled": false },
  "storage": {
    "type": "local",
    "builtIn": false,
    "localPath": "./data/media",
    "s3Bucket": "",
    "s3Region": "",
    "s3Endpoint": "",
    "s3CredentialsSet": false
  },
  "engine": {
    "type": "whatsapp-web.js",
    "headless": true,
    "sessionDataPath": "./data/sessions",
    "browserArgs": "--no-sandbox --disable-gpu"
  }
}
```

When nothing supplies a key — no pinned environment value and the file absent or silent about it — empty-string/default values are returned (`schema='public'`, `poolSize=10`, `sslRejectUnauthorized=true`, `engine.type='whatsapp-web.js'`, `headless=true`).

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### PUT /api/infra/config

Merge-save infrastructure config to `data/.env.generated` (a `0600` secret file). A partial payload preserves untouched keys; empty/omitted secret fields keep the existing stored secret.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `SaveConfigDto` (recursively class-validated; unknown or mistyped fields are rejected)

`engine.type`, or CR-LF in a value · `401` · `403`

#### POST /api/infra/restart

Request a graceful server restart, optionally orchestrating Docker profiles (add/remove services). Schedules process shutdown as a side-effect.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — optional `RestartDto` (class-validated; unknown fields and non-string array members reject)

| Field              | Type     | Required | Default | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `profiles`         | string[] | No       | `[]`    | Docker profiles to enable/start (e.g. `postgres`, `redis`, `minio`) |
| `profilesToRemove` | string[] | No       | `[]`    | Docker profiles whose containers should be stopped/removed          |

```json
{ "profiles": ["postgres", "redis"], "profilesToRemove": ["minio"] }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "message": "Restarting…",
  "restarting": true,
  "profiles": ["postgres", "redis"],
  "profilesToRemove": ["minio"],
  "estimatedTime": 48
}
```

`estimatedTime` (seconds) = base 15 + 20/postgres + 13/redis + 15/minio + 5/removal. `orchestration` is present only when Docker is available and `profiles` is non-empty; `removal` only when Docker is available and `profilesToRemove` is non-empty. Without Docker, a `data/.orchestration-request.json` signal file is written instead. After responding, `shutdownService.shutdown()` runs (default ~3s grace); readiness returns `503` during drain.

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

#### GET /api/infra/export-data

Export every row of the 14 migration tables from the Data DB as JSON. Read-only, but runs raw `SELECT *` on the `data` DataSource.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

> **Inline media is carried up to a budget, then omitted.** `EXPORT_INLINE_MEDIA_BUDGET_BYTES` (8 MiB of encoded base64 by default) bounds how much inline media one export may hold, counted across both `messages` and `messageBatches`. Within each of those tables it is spent newest-first — messages by `timestamp`, batches by `created_at` — so an export that cannot carry everything keeps the most recent media rather than whatever the database happened to return first. Messages are served before batches, so a long history can exhaust the budget before any batch is reached. An over-budget payload on a `messages` row arrives as the omitted marker — `{ mimetype, filename?, omitted: true, sizeBytes }`, the same shape the engine emits when an inbound payload exceeds `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` — so those messages restore without their pictures. A `messageBatches` entry carries no marker: it simply loses its `base64` and keeps `url`, `mimetype` and `caption`, which is the shape a batch already has once it reaches a terminal state. Without the bound, one 50 MiB attachment becomes 66 MiB of base64 and exceeds the import's own request-body limit (`BODY_SIZE_LIMIT`, 25mb by default), producing a backup this gateway refuses to restore with `413`.
>
> An **http/https** payload is never counted or dropped: `metadata.media.data` holds either base64 or the URL a send was given, and such a URL is a pointer worth a few dozen bytes. The scheme is matched case-insensitively, as both engine adapters do when they fetch it; a URL with any other scheme is treated as bytes.
>
> This bounds the media, not the export — a large enough text-only history still exceeds the import limit, because every row costs a few hundred bytes of scaffolding whatever was said. For a backup that keeps everything, use `scripts/backup.sh`: it snapshots the database file itself (and `pg_dump`s Postgres), so inline media rides along regardless of this budget.

The migration set (`MigrationTables`) is, in payload-key order: `sessions`, `webhooks`, `messages`, `messageBatches`, `templates`, `baileysStoredMessages`, `lidMappings`, `pluginInstances`, `conversationMappings`, `ingressEvents`, `webhookDeliveryFailures`, `integrationDeliveryFailures`, `statusUpdates`, `automationRules`.

```

Rows are raw DB column shapes (e.g. `messageBatches` rows use snake_case columns: `batch_id`, `session_id`, `current_index`, `created_at`, …). **`webhooks` rows omit `secret` and `headers`** (webhook credentials are excluded from backups; they restore as `null`/`{}`), while `pluginInstances` rows still carry integration secrets — treat the payload as a credential dump. On Postgres the generated `body_ts` FTS column is stripped from `messages` so archives stay dialect-neutral.

`sessions`/`webhooks` are queried directly, so a hard DB error there yields `500`. The other 12 are queried tolerantly: a _genuinely missing_ table (an older DB that has not run the migration) exports as `[]` and its name is listed in `skippedTables`; any other error (lock, I/O, timeout) fails the export rather than reporting the table as empty. Check `skippedTables` before restoring — a skipped table is "not migrated yet", not "exported empty".

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `500` DB error

#### POST /api/infra/import-data

Replace all Data DB rows with the supplied export. **Destructive and transactional (all-or-nothing).**

> **The replace covers all 14 migration tables, not just the ones you send.** Inside the transaction every table in the migration set is emptied first and only then re-populated from the payload, so a table you omit ends up **empty**, not untouched. Always restore a payload produced by `GET /api/infra/export-data` of the same or a newer build — a hand-built body carrying only a subset silently wipes the rest.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `ImportDataDto`. Post the whole export file: alongside `tables`, `force` and `stopOrphans`, the DTO accepts and ignores the export's `exportedAt`, `dataDbType`, `counts`, `skippedTables` and `omittedInlineMedia`. Any other property is rejected with `400`.

```

`warnings` are per-row import failures — they force a **rollback** and `imported:false`. `notices` are non-fatal operator messages (orphan-engine reconciliation detail) and never roll anything back. `restartRequired` is `true` from any of three causes: engines left pointing at sessions the restore removed (`force`), an orphan teardown that failed, or sessions running on another node, which this request has no channel to stop. `orphanedEngines` lists the session ids with a live engine the restored data no longer contains; `stoppedOrphanEngines`/`failedOrphanEngines` report how `stopOrphans` went.

**Orphan-engine pre-flight.** Before the transaction opens, any running engine whose session id is absent from `tables.sessions` is an orphan (the replace would delete its DB row, leaving an unstoppable engine writing into freshly restored tables). Default behaviour is to refuse with `409` listing those ids; `stopOrphans: true` stops them in-request and proceeds; `force: true` proceeds and leaves them running until restart.

Because that pre-flight runs _before_ the transaction, its teardown is not covered by the rollback. A response with `imported:false` therefore still reports the engines it really stopped, and `restartRequired` on that path means only that a teardown **failed** — a cleanly stopped orphan leaves its session row intact (restart it with `POST /sessions/{sessionId}/start`), and an engine `force` left running was never orphaned after all, since the data that would have orphaned it was not replaced.

Inside the transaction every migration table is emptied. `webhooks` and `sessions` are DELETEd directly, so a missing table there fails the restore; 11 more go through a tolerant helper where a _genuinely missing_ table is skipped; and `automation_rules` is emptied by the `DELETE FROM sessions` cascade rather than by the helper. Any other DELETE failure propagates to the rollback. Rows are then re-inserted, sessions first. JSON object/array fields are auto-stringified before insert, and the Postgres-form `$N` placeholders are rewritten for SQLite. Two guards return `imported:false` after a rollback: any `warnings`, and a payload that restores **zero** rows in total (a wrong/empty backup would otherwise commit a silent wipe — the response then carries `Backup contained no rows to restore; refused to replace existing data. Check the file.`). On commit the lid→phone mirror is reloaded from the restored rows.

**Errors:** `400` `tables` absent/not an object, a table whose value is not an array of rows, a row that is not an object (`null`, a bare string, a nested array), a flag spelled as anything but a boolean or exact `true`/`false`, or a property the route does not accept — nothing is written, and field-level detail is suppressed in production unless `VALIDATION_ERROR_DETAIL=true` · `401` · `403` · `409` refused, with the reason in `code` — `IMPORT_WOULD_ORPHAN_ENGINES` (live engines exist for sessions the backup does not contain; retry with `stopOrphans` or `force`), `IMPORT_ALREADY_RUNNING` (another import is running; wait for it), `IMPORT_NESTED_TRANSACTION` (another database transaction holds the connection; retry with nothing else in flight) · `500` unrecoverable DB error

> A malformed archive is answered before the restore opens its transaction. Every table present is checked for being an array, and every row in it for being an object — not just `sessions`, since the rest are read inside the transaction where the same mistake would fail mid-restore instead of ahead of it. A hand-edited or truncated backup therefore reports `400` naming the offending `tables.<name>[<index>]`, rather than the `500` that told the operator the server had broken when their file was simply wrong.

#### GET /api/infra/storage/files/count

File count and total size in the active storage backend.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "storageType": "local", "count": 128, "sizeBytes": 5242880, "sizeMB": "5.00" }

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/plugins/catalog

List the remote plugin catalog annotated with this instance's install state. (Declared before `:id` so `catalog` is not captured as an id.)

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` `Plugin {id} not found`

---

#### GET /api/plugins/:id/config-ui

Serve a plugin's sandboxed config-UI entry HTML (for an opaque-origin iframe `srcdoc`; the dashboard
applies its document-specific CSP nonce to inline scripts and keeps any declared schema form available as fallback).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type   | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id   |

**Response** `200` — raw HTML (not JSON). Headers: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`, `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type   | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |

#### POST /api/plugins/install

Install a plugin from an uploaded `.zip` package.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `multipart/form-data` (no DTO)

| Field  | Type            | Required | Constraints                                  | Description                         |

| `file` | binary (`.zip`) | Yes      | ≤ 5 MB; must contain a valid plugin manifest | Form field name is literally `file` |

**Response** `201` — the newly installed `PluginDto`.

Reinstalling over a plugin whose code went missing is supported and is the recovery the boot warning
prescribes: its `ctx.storage` directory, config, session activations and enabled-on-boot decision are
all kept. A directory the gateway did not install is still refused.

**Errors:** `400` no file / invalid package / install failed · `401` · `403` · `409` plugin already loaded, or a directory under that id the gateway did not install

---

#### POST /api/plugins/install-url

Install a plugin by downloading its `.zip` from a URL (SSRF-guarded fetch: host validated, redirects followed with every hop re-validated through the guard and the chain capped at 5 hops, size-capped at `plugins.downloadMaxBytes`, default 5 MB). `https://` is accepted as-is; plain `http://` is only accepted when the URL carries a content pin (below) — the package is executable code and must be integrity-protected in transit; private-network targets remain subject to the SSRF guard. A redirect hop that downgrades back to plain `http://` mid-chain is likewise refused (set `PLUGIN_DOWNLOAD_ALLOW_INSECURE_REDIRECTS=true` only if your vendor genuinely redirects that way); a chain over the cap fails with an explicit "too many redirects" error.

Content pinning: append `#sha256=<64 hex>` (URL fragment — never sent to the server) to require the downloaded bytes to match that digest; the fragment is the only honored marker — query params are deliberately ignored. A mismatch or a malformed marker fails the install closed. The pin is optional over HTTPS (TLS + the SSRF guard are the baseline) and REQUIRED over plain HTTP, which is rejected without one.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `InstallFromUrlDto` (class-validated; extra fields → `400`)

Update a plugin's base configuration object.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

```

**Errors:** `400` plugin is global (not session-scoped) / extra field · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### PUT /api/plugins/:id/sessions

Set which sessions a session-scoped plugin is activated for. This is a **full replacement** of the plugin's global activation set: the supplied `sessions` array overwrites `activeSessions` in its entirety (not a merge), so an omitted session is deactivated and `[]` deactivates the plugin for every session.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is **not restricted to specific sessions** (`@RequireUnscopedKey`). Because the route replaces the whole activation set, a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` whatever it sends — even a request confined to its own `allowedSessions` would silently delete every other session's activation, so the fence refuses scoped keys before the handler runs. Use an unrestricted ADMIN key. (The per-session config override route `PUT /api/plugins/:id/config/:sessionId` is a different operation and stays scoped to the addressed session.)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type   | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id   |

**Request body** — `PluginSessionsDto` (class-validated)

| Field      | Type     | Required | Constraints                              | Description                                             |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions` | string[] | Yes      | `@IsArray()`, `@IsString({ each:true })` | Session ids to activate for. `["*"]` = all, `[]` = none |

```json
{ "sessions": ["*"] }
```

**Response** `200` — the updated `PluginDto` (reflecting the new `activeSessions`).

**Errors:** `400` plugin is global · `401` · `403` key is session-scoped (full activation replacement requires an unrestricted key) · `404` unknown id

#### POST /api/plugins/:id/update

Update an installed plugin in place from a URL, preserving config + enabled state. The new package is written to a staging sibling and validated BEFORE the running plugin is stopped, then swapped in with two renames (live → backup, staging → live); a failure before or during the swap restores the previous version, and a process crash mid-swap is reconciled at boot (the backup is restored when the live directory is missing), so an interrupted update can never make the plugin silently vanish. The URL follows the same transport rule as `install-url`: https as-is, plain http only with a `#sha256=` digest pin (fail-closed on mismatch).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type   | Description                                      |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `id` | string | Plugin id (must match the package's manifest id) |

**Request body** — `InstallFromUrlDto` (class-validated)

| Field | Type   | Required | Constraints                                                     | Description                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url` | string | Yes      | `@IsUrl({ protocols:['http','https'], require_protocol:true })` | Absolute URL of the new `.zip` (SSRF-guarded download); https as-is, http only with a `#sha256=` pin |

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/plugins/chat-flow-1.1.0.zip" }
```

**Response** `201` — the updated `PluginDto`.

**Errors:** `400` download/package invalid, manifest id mismatch, or built-in plugin · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### DELETE /api/plugins/:id

Uninstall a plugin: dispatch its `onUnload` lifecycle hook, delete its files, drop its registry entry, and remove its `ctx.storage` data directory (`<dataDir>/plugins/<id>` — a separate tree when `PLUGINS_DIR` points outside the data dir). Built-in plugins are protected. A plugin that is installed but not loaded — one whose code went missing — can be uninstalled too; there is simply no runtime to tear down first. `404` therefore means an id the gateway has no registry entry for.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type   | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id   |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Plugin uninstalled successfully" }
```

Note: this DELETE returns `200` with a body (not the usual `204`).

**Errors:** `400` cannot uninstall (e.g. built-in) · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### POST /api/integration/instances/:pluginId/:instanceId/redrive

Re-dispatch one bounded batch of dead-lettered inbound deliveries for an integration instance (see
**doc 25, Integration Fabric** for the DLQ and redrive design). Rows are drained fewest-attempts-first,
then oldest-first, up to `batchSize` (100) — so a row that keeps failing moves behind never-retried
rows instead of livelocking the window, while staying redrivable. `remaining` reports the DLQ depth
still outstanding after this batch.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) · **Scope:** session-scoped (a key restricted to `allowedSessions` may only
redrive an instance whose current `sessionScope` is inside that allowlist; out of scope and missing
instances both answer `404`, so redrive can't be used to probe other sessions). An unrestricted key is
not fenced this way: it may drain retained rows for an instance that no longer exists, which is
deliberate — those rows still carry the deleted binding's `sessionId` and only an unscoped caller may
replay them.

**Path parameters**

| Name         | Type   | Description                   |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `pluginId`   | string | Plugin id owning the instance |
| `instanceId` | string | Instance id to redrive        |

**Response** `201`

```json
{ "redriven": 3, "remaining": 0, "batchSize": 100 }
```

**Errors:** `401` · `403` key role < ADMIN · `404` a **scoped** key's instance that is missing or outside its `allowedSessions` (an unrestricted key gets `201` with `redriven: 0` instead)

---

#### POST /mcp

MCP Streamable-HTTP / JSON-RPC 2.0 transport that exposes the agent-tool registry over the Model Context Protocol. **This is a transport, not a REST resource** — there is no NestJS controller, no DTO, and no `{success,data}` shape.

**Auth:** API key — sent as `X-Api-Key: <key>` **or** `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Auth is enforced **per tool call** inside the MCP layer (not by the global Nest guard), so an auth failure surfaces in-band, not as an HTTP `401`.

Key facts:

- **Path is exactly `POST /mcp` — no `/api` prefix.** The global `api` prefix applies only to Nest controllers; this route is mounted straight on Express.
- Gated by **`MCP_ENABLED=true`**. When off, the module/route is never mounted and `POST /mcp` returns `404`.
- MCP is **read-only by default**: only read-tier tools are registered unless you set `MCP_READONLY=false` to expose write tools. Per-key sliding-window rate limit: `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default 60) per `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` (default 60000).
- Stateless transport (no SSE/session id for normal calls).

**Request body** — JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope (validated by the MCP SDK, **not** the Nest ValidationPipe)

| Field     | Type                     | Required | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `jsonrpc` | string                   | Yes      | Must be `"2.0"`                                                                                                    |
| `id`      | string \| number \| null | No       | Request id echoed back; null/absent for notifications                                                              |
| `method`  | string                   | Yes      | `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, plus MCP lifecycle methods. Unknown → JSON-RPC error `-32601`            |
| `params`  | object                   | No       | Method-specific. For `tools/call`: `{ name, arguments }` where `arguments` must match the tool's zod `inputSchema` |

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "session_send_text",
    "arguments": { "sessionId": "default", "to": "6281234567890", "text": "Hello from MCP" }
  }
}
```

**Response** `200` — JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": { "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "{\"success\":true,\"messageId\":\"…\"}" }] }
}
```

For `tools/call` the result is an MCP `CallToolResult` (`content` array of `text` or embedded base64 `resource` items — payloads over 4096 bytes become a `resource`). **Tool-level failures are returned in-band as `CallToolResult` with `isError:true`** (HTTP stays 200), including missing/invalid API key (`name:'UnauthorizedException'`) and rate-limit hits (`message:'MCP rate limit exceeded'`).

**Errors:** in-band JSON-RPC errors `-32601` (unknown method), `-32602` (invalid params / unknown tool), `-32700` (parse error), all at HTTP 200 · `500` only if the transport throws before headers are sent · `404` when `MCP_ENABLED` is not `true`

> The full catalog of MCP tools (names, tiers, schemas) is documented separately — see **doc 24, MCP Integration**. This section documents only the transport endpoint.

### 6.4.12 Search

Base path `/api/search`. Cross-session full-text message search over an open `SearchProvider` contract;
the built-in database full-text provider (PostgreSQL `tsvector`/`GIN`, SQLite `FTS5`) answers by
default with zero external dependencies. Search is on by default; set `SEARCH_ENABLED=false` to remove
the route and module entirely (the index is DB-maintained regardless — see
[26 - Global Search](./26-global-search.md)). Requires at least `OPERATOR` role.

**Auth:** API key (≥ `OPERATOR`) · **Scope:** session-scoped — a scoped key's `allowedSessions` is
injected server-side from the key (never from the query), so a scoped key cannot broaden its reach; an
ADMIN / null-allowlist key searches all sessions.

#### GET /api/search

Search messages across sessions (active search provider).

**Query parameters**

| Name        | Type                            | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `q`         | string                          | **Yes**  | —       | Search term. Must be non-empty after trim; whitespace-only is rejected with `400`. Passed to the active provider's native full-text matcher.                                                  |
| `sessionId` | string                          | No       | —       | Restrict to a single session id (intersected with the key's `allowedSessions` scope).                                                                                                         |

| `direction` | enum (`incoming` \| `outgoing`) | No       | —       | Filter by message direction.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `type`      | string                          | No       | —       | Filter by stored message `type` (e.g. `text`, `image`, `video`). Compared against `messages.type`; not an enum validation, any string is accepted and unmatched values simply return no hits. |
| `from`      | string                          | No       | —       | Filter by sender.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `dateFrom`  | integer (epoch ms)              | No       | —       | Inclusive lower bound on `timestamp`. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`.                                                                                                             |
| `dateTo`    | integer (epoch ms)              | No       | —       | Inclusive upper bound on `timestamp`. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`.                                                                                                             |
| `limit`     | integer (≥ 1)                   | No       | `50`    | Max hits to return. Clamped to `SEARCH_LIMIT_MAX` (default `100`). A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`.                                                                                |
| `offset`    | integer (≥ 0)                   | No       | `0`     | Pagination offset. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`.                                                                                                                                |

**Response** `200` — `SearchResults`

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "messageId": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
      "waMessageId": "true_62812...@c.us_3A...",
      "sessionId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
      "body": "full original message body...",
      "snippet": "...order <mark>confirmed</mark> for tomorrow…",
      "timestamp": 1751904000000,
      "type": "text",
      "direction": "incoming",
      "from": "6281234567890@c.us",
      "score": 0.075
    }
  ],
  "total": 23,
  "tookMs": 6,
  "provider": "builtin-fts"
}
```

- `snippet` is an XSS-safe text excerpt with `<mark>`/`</mark>` highlight markers around the matched
  term (both dialects emit the same markers). Render it as text, never as HTML.
- `total` is an exact count for pagination, computed lazily only when the returned page could be full.
- `provider` names which backend answered (e.g. `builtin-fts`); it is the registered `SearchProvider`
  id, so it changes when a plugin backend is selected via `SEARCH_PROVIDER`.
- `score` is optional and provider-specific (rank ordering is stable within a provider; cross-provider
  scores are not comparable).

**Errors:** `400` empty/whitespace `q`, a non-numeric `dateFrom`/`dateTo`/`limit`/`offset`, or a malformed
SQLite FTS5 query (unbalanced quote/paren, bare operator) — Postgres's `websearch_to_tsquery` is
tolerant and has no equivalent · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key role below `OPERATOR` ·
`501` no search provider configured (including a non-FTS5 SQLite build, where the provider is absent) ·
`502` the active plugin provider returned an invalid result shape (not retryable until the plugin is fixed) ·
`503` the active plugin provider did not answer (worker not running, timed out, or reported a failure;
retryable). The built-in provider returns neither `502` nor `503`.

> Scoping is authoritative: a scoped API key's `allowedSessions` is applied server-side and cannot be
> overridden via the query — there is no `sessionIds` query parameter, and `SearchService` overwrites
> any session scope at the provider boundary.

### 6.4.13 Profile (own account)

Manage the linked account's own profile. All routes are nested under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/profile` and require an **OPERATOR** key.

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/name

Set the account display name (max 25 chars).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

```json
{ "name": "ACME Support" }
```

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile name updated" }`

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / invalid name · `401` · `403` the whatsapp-web.js engine refused the change (the Baileys engine has no acceptance signal and answers `200`) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/status

Set the account about/status text (max 139 chars; empty string clears it).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

```json
{ "status": "We reply within one business day" }
```

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile status updated" }`

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / status too long · `401` · `403` · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/picture

Set the account profile picture from a URL or base64 image (same media DTO conventions as message sends, §6.3).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/avatar.png" }
```

or

```json
{ "base64": "iVBORw0KGgo...", "mimetype": "image/png" }
```

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile picture updated" }`

**Errors:** `400` neither `url` nor `base64` provided / base64 without `mimetype` · `401` · `403` the whatsapp-web.js engine refused the change (the Baileys engine has no acceptance signal and answers `200`) · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `413` payload too large · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/picture

Remove the account profile picture, leaving the account with WhatsApp's default avatar.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

No request body.

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile picture removed" }`

Removing a picture that is already absent is a no-op and also answers `200`, so the call is safe to
repeat.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` · `403` engine refused the removal · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

### 6.4.14 Calls

Incoming-call management. A `call.received` webhook/socket event (§6.6) announces an incoming ringing call and carries the `callId` used below.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/calls/link

Generate a shareable WhatsApp call link.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) · **Scope:** session-scoped

**Request body** — `CreateCallLinkDto`

| Field       | Type   | Required | Constraints                | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`      | string | Yes      | `@IsIn(['audio','video'])` | Which kind of call the link opens                     |
| `startTime` | number | Yes      | `@IsInt`; `@Min(1)`        | Epoch **milliseconds** the call is scheduled to start |

```json
{ "type": "video", "startTime": 1800000000000 }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "link": "https://call.whatsapp.com/video/XxXxXxXxXxXxXx" }
```

> **`startTime` is required on purpose.** whatsapp-web.js generates an _event-linked_ call and has no
> notion of "no start time", so a link for right now is `Date.now()` rather than an omitted field.
> Sending it in seconds instead of milliseconds produces a link scheduled in 1970.

> **`audio` is the neutral spelling; WhatsApp's own URL path is `/voice/`.** Baileys uses `audio`,
> whatsapp-web.js uses `voice`, and the generated link reads
> `https://call.whatsapp.com/voice/…` either way.

> **A refusal is a `403`, never a `200` with an empty link.** whatsapp-web.js returns an empty string
> when generation fails and Baileys returns no token; both become `EngineRefusedError`, because a
> caller handed `{ "link": "" }` — or a bare prefix with nothing after it — would pass it to a user
> before discovering it is dead.

**Errors:** `400` session not ready, or an invalid `type`/`startTime` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` WhatsApp generated no link · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `500` the whatsapp-web.js page died mid-request (deliberately not `503`: each call mints a new link, so a client replaying a `503` would create a second one)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/calls/:callId/reject

Reject a currently ringing incoming call. Only a live call can be rejected — the id is valid while the call rings (a short server-side cache); afterwards it expires.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name      | Type   | Description                            |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID                             |
| callId    | string | Call ID from the `call.received` event |

**Request body** — none.

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `404` call not found or no longer ringing · `409` conflict or engine not ready (retryable) · `503` session not ready or dependency unavailable (retryable)

> **Auto-reject per session.** Set `"config": { "autoRejectCalls": true }` when creating a session to have the server reject every incoming call automatically — the `call.received` event is still dispatched first, so automations keep full visibility.

### 6.4.15 Media conversion (opt-in)

Server-side transcoding into the shapes WhatsApp clients actually play. Disabled by default; set
`MEDIA_CONVERSION_ENABLED=true`. The official Docker image already ships the `ffmpeg` binary these
endpoints run — on a source install it must be present, or they answer `503`.

Nothing is converted implicitly: sends behave exactly as before unless a caller runs media through
these endpoints first and posts the result.

> **Why voice conversion matters.** WhatsApp renders a playable voice-note bubble only for Ogg/Opus.
> Posting MP3 bytes to `send-audio` with `ptt: true` sends those bytes as they are, so the recipient
> gets a mic bubble that will not play. Converting first is what produces a real voice note.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/media/convert

Report whether conversion is both switched on and actually runnable here, so a client can choose
between converting server-side and converting before it sends.

**Auth:** API key

**Response** `200` — `{ "available": true }`

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/media/convert/voice

Convert audio (or the audio track of a video) into a WhatsApp voice note: Ogg/Opus, mono, 48 kHz,
tuned for speech. Post the returned `base64` to `send-audio` with `ptt: true`.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Request body**

| Name   | Type   | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| url    | string | Public http(s) URL to fetch (server-side, SSRF-guarded) |
| base64 | string | Inline bytes. Takes precedence when both are given      |

Exactly one of `url` / `base64` is required. No `mimetype` is accepted: the input format is
identified from the bytes.

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "base64": "T2dnUwACAAAA...", "mimetype": "audio/ogg; codecs=opus", "bytes": 14970 }
```

**Errors:** `400` neither field given, or ffmpeg refused the input (its reason is included) · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `413` media above the size cap · `503` conversion is disabled, the ffmpeg binary is not runnable, or the conversion queue is saturated

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/media/convert/video

Convert video into an MP4 every WhatsApp client accepts: baseline H.264 with AAC audio, long edge
bounded at 1280 (never upscaled), index moved to the front so playback can start before the whole
file arrives.

**Errors:** `400` neither field given, or ffmpeg refused the input (its reason is included) · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `413` media above the size cap · `503` conversion is disabled, the ffmpeg binary is not runnable, or the conversion queue is saturated

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "base64": "AAAAIGZ0eXBpc29t...", "mimetype": "video/mp4", "bytes": 90660 }
```

**Size note.** Both endpoints return the converted media inline, so the response is bounded by the
same `MEDIA_CONVERSION_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` cap (default 50 MiB) — and a client posting it onward is
still bound by `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` (default 25 MiB) on that next request.

### 6.4.16 Automation rules (autoreply)

Single-message autoreply rules, managed under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/automation-rules`
(`AutomationRuleController`). Every route requires an API key with **OPERATOR** role or higher.

When an inbound message arrives, the session's enabled rules are evaluated in order — creation
time, `id` as the same-second tiebreak — and the **first** rule whose `conditions` match replies
into the chat with its `replyText`. The reply goes through the ordinary send path, so send pacing
and plugin vetoes apply to it like any other outbound message. Evaluation is fire-and-forget off
the receive path and runs at most once per message (engine re-fires are deduplicated).

`conditions` uses the **webhook filter format** (`message` family — see 6.4.8): a flat AND list of
conditions over `sender`, `recipient`, `body`, `type`, `isGroup`, `fromMe`, `hasMedia`, `mentions`.
Omitted or empty conditions match every inbound message.

Loop safety: a rule never answers the account's own (`fromMe`) messages, messages older than
5 minutes get no automated answer (so a reconnect never burst-replies the offline-queued backlog),
and `cooldownSeconds` (default 60, `0` disables, max 86400) keeps the rule quiet per chat after it
fires. Be clear about what this guarantees: the cooldown **rate-bounds** an
autoreply-vs-autoreply exchange with another bot, it does not terminate one — and
`cooldownSeconds: 0` removes that bound entirely, so disable it only for rules whose conditions
cannot match another bot's replies. The cooldown state is in-process: it resets on restart.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/automation-rules

### 6.4.17 Integration fabric (ingress & instances)

The operator surface of the Integration Fabric — **doc 25** holds the design (DLQ, ordering,
per-instance fairness); this section is the route reference. An ADMIN key provisions per-plugin
instances — one bound provider account, e.g. one Chatwoot inbox — and each instance gets one
ingress URL per route the plugin declares. Only a plugin that declares an ingress route AND the
`webhook:ingress` permission can have instances; any other plugin is rejected before persistence.

An instance's ingress `secret` and `verifyToken` are revealed **once** — in the create and
regenerate-secret responses — and masked (`***`) on every later read. `config` fields flagged
`secret` in the plugin's config schema stay masked even in those one-shot reveal responses.

Every instance route is session-scope aware: a key restricted to `allowedSessions` only sees
instances bound to one of its own sessions, and an out-of-scope instance answers `404` (identical
to a missing one), so the routes cannot probe which instances exist on other sessions. The DLQ
redrive route is documented with the administration routes in §6.4.11.

#### DELETE /api/ingress/:pluginId/:instanceId/:path

One route, any HTTP method: the inbound webhook endpoint an external provider delivers to. The
trailing `:path` segment is the plugin-declared route (it may contain slashes, e.g.
`events/message`); a delivery to a route the plugin did not claim is a `404`.

**Auth:** **none** — `@Public` by design, because a provider cannot present an API key. What
authenticates a delivery is the per-instance HMAC signature over the exact raw body bytes (the body
is read raw, never DTO-bound, so the signed bytes reach the verifier unchanged). A `GET` here is
the provider's verification handshake and answers only when its `verifyToken` matches.

**Response** — the primary success path is `202`: the delivery is persisted and queued for async
plugin processing. `200` means the `GET` verification-challenge echo, or a duplicate delivery
already persisted (idempotent re-delivery). A route may shape the synchronous status/body/headers
the provider sees via its declarative `ack` config (doc 25); the plugin itself always runs async.

**Errors:** `401` signature verification failed (missing, stale, or wrong secret) · `403` `GET` verification challenge failed (`verifyToken` mismatch) · `404` unknown pluginId/instanceId, or no such claimed route · `413` body over the route's `maxBodyBytes` · `429` rate limit: the per-instance bucket (`INGRESS_INSTANCE_LIMIT`) or the per-client-IP bucket (`INGRESS_IP_LIMIT`), both per `INGRESS_INSTANCE_TTL`; the global per-IP tiers skip this route, so these two are its bounds, and `Retry-After-instance` / `Retry-After-ingress-ip` names the one that shed the request

## 6.5 Real-time API (WebSocket)

Live events are delivered over a **Socket.IO** connection (not a raw WebSocket). The server mounts a single Socket.IO namespace, **`/events`**, on the same port as the REST API. There are no REST routes in this module.

### Connecting

Point a Socket.IO client at `<host>:2785` with path-less namespace `/events`:

```
ws://<host>:2785/events      (or wss:// behind TLS)
```

The client must authenticate during the Socket.IO handshake. Two sources are accepted, in this precedence order:

1. **Handshake `auth` (recommended)** — `io(url, { auth: { apiKey } })`. Not written to URLs or access logs.
2. **Header** — `x-api-key: <key>`.

> The former `?apiKey=<key>` query fallback was **removed** — it leaked the credential into proxy/access logs. Pass the key via the handshake `auth` field or the `x-api-key` header only.

If no key is supplied, or validation fails, the server emits an `error` message (`code: "UNAUTHORIZED"`) on the `message` event and immediately disconnects the socket. CORS for the namespace reuses the HTTP `CORS_ORIGINS` policy (dev allows any origin; production uses the allowlist).

### Protocol — client → server

All client commands are sent on the Socket.IO event named **`message`** using a single **flat** envelope:

```
{ type, sessionId, events, requestId }
```

| Field       | Type                                     | Applies to             | Description                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`      | `"subscribe" \| "unsubscribe" \| "ping"` | all                    | Command discriminator.                                    |
| `sessionId` | string                                   | subscribe, unsubscribe | A session id, or `"*"` for all sessions.                  |
| `events`    | string[]                                 | subscribe              | Event names to subscribe to, or `["*"]` for all.          |
| `requestId` | string (optional)                        | all                    | Echoed back on the matching server reply for correlation. |

A `ping` carries only `{ type: "ping", requestId? }`.

### Protocol — server → client

All server replies and pushed events also arrive on the Socket.IO event named **`message`**.

Command acknowledgements are **flat** and include an ISO-8601 `timestamp`:

```json
{
  "type": "subscribed",
  "sessionId": "main",
  "events": ["message.received", "session.status"],
  "requestId": "r1",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

```json
{ "type": "unsubscribed", "sessionId": "main", "requestId": "r2", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:01.000Z" }
```

```json
{ "type": "pong", "requestId": "r3", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:02.000Z" }
```

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "FORBIDDEN_SESSION",
  "message": "API key is not authorized for this session",
  "requestId": "r1",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Live events are pushed as a **nested** envelope (note: `data` is under `payload`, and there is no `requestId`):

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:05.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "event": "message.received",
    "sessionId": "main",
    "data": { "id": "ABCD1234", "from": "6281234567890@c.us", "body": "hi", "timestamp": 1750000000 }
  }
}
```

Error `code` values include `UNAUTHORIZED`, `INVALID_MESSAGE`, `INVALID_SESSION`, `INVALID_EVENTS`, and `FORBIDDEN_SESSION`.

### Subscribable events

`events` accepts the wildcard `"*"` (all of the below) or any of these exact names:

```
message.received
message.sent
message.ack
message.revoked
message.reaction
message.edited
session.status
session.qr
session.authenticated
session.disconnected
session.restriction
presence.update
group.join
group.leave
group.update
group.join_request
call.received
call.accepted
call.rejected
call.missed
status.received
```

A subscribe request whose `events` array contains no recognized name (after filtering) is rejected with `INVALID_EVENTS`. Unknown names mixed with valid ones are silently dropped; the `subscribed` reply echoes only the accepted events.

> `message.failed` and `session.reconnect_loop` are webhook-only — they are not subscribable on the socket.

### Wildcards and scoping

- **`sessionId: "*"`** subscribes to every session; **`events: ["*"]`** subscribes to every subscribable event. They combine (e.g. `"*"` + `["*"]` = every event of every session).
- The API key is **re-validated on every `subscribe`** (not just at connect), so a key revoked or expired mid-connection is caught — the server replies `UNAUTHORIZED` and disconnects.
- **Per-key session scope is enforced** against the fresh key: a key restricted via `allowedSessions` may NOT subscribe to `"*"` and may NOT subscribe to a session outside its allowlist — either is rejected with `FORBIDDEN_SESSION`. An unrestricted key (no `allowedSessions`) may subscribe to anything, including `"*"`.

### Example (socket.io-client)

```js
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('ws://localhost:2785/events', {
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.OPENWA_API_KEY },
});

socket.on('connect', () => {
  socket.emit('message', {
    type: 'subscribe',
    sessionId: 'main',
    events: ['message.received', 'message.ack', 'session.status'],
    requestId: 'sub-1',
  });
});

socket.on('message', msg => {
  if (msg.type === 'event') {
    console.log(`[${msg.payload.event}]`, msg.payload.sessionId, msg.payload.data);
  } else {
    console.log('reply:', msg); // subscribed | unsubscribed | pong | error
  }
});
```

## 6.6 Webhook Events & Delivery Semantics

Every registered webhook receives an HTTP `POST` with a JSON body of this shape:

```json
{
  "event": "message.received",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-02T10:00:00.000Z",
  "sessionId": "my-session",
  "idempotencyKey": "msg_my-session_3EB0ABC123",
  "deliveryId": "dlv_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": {}
}
```

`event`, `timestamp` (ISO-8601 dispatch time), `sessionId`, `idempotencyKey`, and `deliveryId` are always present; `data` holds the event-specific payload. The same values are mirrored into request headers (below). The HMAC `signature` is **not** in the body — it travels in the `X-OpenWA-Signature` header.

### Event catalog

These are the events OpenWA actually emits. A webhook is registered with an `events` list; an event is delivered to a webhook when its `events` array includes the event name or `"*"`.

The engines report _what_ happened, never _who_ did it: an accept can come from any linked device. An outcome is only sent for a call this session saw ring, and offline-replayed signalling for calls that ended while disconnected is dropped. WhatsApp's `terminate` is deliberately unmapped — it covers both a caller hanging up before answer and either side ending an answered call, with nothing to tell them apart |
| `status.received`                                 | A contact posts a status/story (opt-in — see below)                                                                                                                                                                                   | `{ sessionId, statusId, contact: { id, name?, pushName? }, type, caption?, hasMedia, mediaOmitted, omitReason?, postedAt, expiresAt }` — `statusId` is the store's `id` (usable with the status endpoints below); `postedAt`/`expiresAt` are epoch **milliseconds** (unlike the epoch-seconds convention for message timestamps), matching the `GET /status` store's own `Date`-backed fields                                                                                                                                                                                            |

> **`status.received` is opt-in and carries no media blob.** Unlike every other event above, `status.received` is only delivered to a webhook whose `events` list explicitly includes `"status.received"` (or `"*"`) — registering for other events does not implicitly subscribe you to it. The payload never embeds media bytes: when `hasMedia` is `true`, fetch the file separately via `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:statusId/media`. Your own posted statuses never trigger this event — only inbound stories from contacts (an own-send echo is dropped before ingest).

> **`STORE_EPHEMERAL_MESSAGES=false` affects `message.received`.** When `STORE_EPHEMERAL_MESSAGES` is set to `false`, incoming disappearing messages (those with `ephemeralDuration > 0`) are **not** persisted nor dispatched — no DB insert, no webhook delivery, and no websocket event. Downstream consumers and the dashboard both stop seeing them. Default is `true` (backward compatible — store and dispatch everything).

> **`senderPhone` on `message.received` is opt-in (`RESOLVE_LID_TO_PHONE`).** When a sender is identified by a WhatsApp privacy id (`…@lid`) rather than a phone number, setting `RESOLVE_LID_TO_PHONE=true` attaches a best-effort `senderPhone` — MSISDN digits, or `null` when the engine cannot map the id — before dispatch, so the webhook and the websocket event both carry it in the same pass. Default is **off**, and while it is off the field is absent from every payload: resolving costs a per-sender lookup (cached). Only inbound privacy-id senders are resolved — a sender that already is a phone number needs no lookup, and own-sends are skipped. The on-demand `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/phone` works regardless of this flag.

> **`contact` on `message.received` is minimal unless you opt in (`WEBHOOK_CONTACT_DETAILS`).** By default the payload carries only `contact { name?, pushName? }`. Setting `WEBHOOK_CONTACT_DETAILS=true` adds `id`, `number`, `shortName`, `type`, `isMyContact`, `isWAContact`, `isBusiness`, `isEnterprise`, `verifiedName`, `verifiedLevel`, `isBlocked` and `labels`, each present only when the engine has a value for it. Every field is copied from the contact record the engine has already loaded for the message, so opting in costs no extra WhatsApp lookup and cannot add rate-limiting pressure. The same enrichment reaches the websocket event, since both are dispatched from one payload. `contact` itself is omitted entirely when the engine has no value for any of its fields, so treat the whole object as optional rather than just its members. **whatsapp-web.js only** — the Baileys path emits `contact { pushName }` when a push name is available, and never reads this flag.

> **Large media is not inlined into webhook payloads.** A `media` blob whose decoded size exceeds `WEBHOOK_MEDIA_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (default **1 MiB**; `0` = never inline) is replaced — before the payload is fanned out to your webhook — with the marker form `media: { mimetype, filename?, omitted: true, sizeBytes }`, the same shape the engine emits for capped inbound media. Media at or under the cap stays inline unchanged. Additionally, if the serialized body still exceeds `WEBHOOK_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` (default **1 MiB**) after `webhook:before` hooks ran, any remaining inline media is shed the same way so the event is still delivered; only a payload that is over budget _without_ inline media is dropped (recorded in `GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures`). Because shedding happens before enqueue, queued and failed BullMQ jobs in Redis never carry the blob either — failed-job retention is bounded by the queue's `removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail` windows (1h/1000 completed, 24h/5000 failed). Fetch the media itself afterwards via `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/history?includeMedia=true` when you need it. The **WebSocket** `message.received` / `message.sent` events apply the same cap and the same marker: an over-cap blob is never broadcast to subscribed sockets (or, with the Redis adapter enabled, replicated across every replica's pub/sub link), and the media stays fetchable via that same history route.

> There is **no** `contact.update` event. `presence.update` is emitted only for chats you have subscribed to (see the presence-subscription endpoint); call outcomes are reported as `call.accepted`, `call.rejected` and `call.missed` alongside `call.received`.

> **Group-event timing caveat (Baileys).** Membership/metadata changes that occurred while a Baileys session was offline are replayed by WhatsApp on reconnect and are dispatched like live events — but the engine does not forward their original occurrence time, so they carry the **receipt time** as `timestamp`. Treat `group.*` payloads as change notifications rather than a precise clock; stale offline _calls_ are never emitted this way (they are filtered by the `offline` flag).

### Delivery semantics — at-least-once

Webhook delivery is **at-least-once**. A consumer can legitimately receive the same logical event more than once because:

- The underlying WhatsApp engine can re-fire an event for a single message.
- A failed delivery (non-2xx response, timeout, or network error) is retried.

**Crash boundary.** Every delivery is recorded before it is attempted, and the record is retired once something durable owns it: the queue job in queued mode, the completed send in direct mode. A hard crash (SIGKILL, OOM) therefore leaves the record behind, and a bounded sweep (`WEBHOOK_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS`, default 60s) replays whatever is still stranded, reusing the stored `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key` so the retry stays deduplicable at your receiver. A delivery that keeps failing exhausts `WEBHOOK_RECONCILE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and goes terminal rather than replaying forever. One window remains open: a crash between persisting the message and writing that record loses the delivery, because the two are not yet one transaction. The failure table records exhausted retries, plus over-budget, dispatch-capacity-exceeded, and shutdown-rejected deliveries with attempts 0. Read the last two as a report rather than a verdict: a delivery the dispatcher shed for capacity or refused during the drain keeps its record and is replayed by the same sweep, so a row there can belong to an event that was later delivered. Enabling the queue (`QUEUE_ENABLED=true`, needs Redis) makes the dispatch durable from the enqueue onward. In both modes, a graceful shutdown drains in-flight deliveries first: the queued path waits for each worker's current job, and the direct path waits up to `WEBHOOK_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_MS` (default 5s; raise it to at least `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`, default 10s, if a slow receiver must finish).

**Design your handler to be idempotent**, keyed on the `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key` header (see below). As a server-side safety net, OpenWA de-duplicates inbound `message.received` before dispatch (a re-fired event for an already-persisted message is dropped), so one webhook normally sees each inbound message once — but this is best-effort defense-in-depth and does not remove the need for consumer-side idempotency.

When a webhook is registered with a `secret`, each delivery carries:

```
X-OpenWA-Signature: sha256=<hex>
```

The hex is an HMAC-SHA256 computed over the **raw JSON request body** (exactly the bytes sent) using the webhook's `secret`. Verify by recomputing over the raw body — not over a re-serialized parse — and compare in constant time:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verify(rawBody, header, secret) {
  const expected = 'sha256=' + crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(header), Buffer.from(expected));
}
```

If no `secret` is configured the `X-OpenWA-Signature` header is omitted entirely.

### Idempotency & delivery headers

Every delivery includes:

| Header                     | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `X-OpenWA-Event`           | The event name (mirrors `event`)                                                                             |
| `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key` | Content-derived key; **stable across retries** of the same occurrence — dedupe on this                       |
| `X-OpenWA-Delivery-Id`     | A fresh `dlv_<uuid>` generated **per delivery** (differs per retry and per webhook) — for tracing, not dedup |
| `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count`     | Retry attempt number (`0` = first attempt)                                                                   |
| `X-OpenWA-Signature`       | HMAC (only when a secret is set)                                                                             |

**Idempotency key derivation.** The key is content-derived so duplicates of the same logical event collapse to one value:

- `message.received` / `message.sent`: `msg_{sessionId}_{messageId}`
- `message.ack`: `ack_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{status}`
- `message.failed`: `failed_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{status}`
- `message.revoked`: `rev_{sessionId}_{messageId}`
- `message.edited`: `edit_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{occurredAt}`
- `message.reaction`: `react_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{senderId}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.qr`: `qr_{sessionId}_{hash(qr)}`
- `session.status`: `sess_{sessionId}_{status}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.authenticated`: `auth_{sessionId}_{hash(data)}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.disconnected`: `disc_{sessionId}_{hash(reason)}_{occurredAt}`
- `group.join` / `group.leave`: `grp_{groupId}_{hash(participantIds)}_{join|leave}_{occurredAt}`
- `group.update`: `grp_{groupId}_update_{hash(changes)}_{occurredAt}`
- `group.join_request`: `grp_{groupId}_{hash(participantIds)}_join_request_{occurredAt}` (salted like `group.join` — a rejected user can legitimately ask again)
- `call.received`: `call_{sessionId}_{callId}` (a call id is unique per call, so no `occurredAt` salt)

Recurring lifecycle events (and `message.reaction` / `message.edited`) carry the same content across occurrences — the same phone on every reconnect, a constant disconnect reason, a re-applied emoji, or editing the same message multiple times — so they are salted with an `occurredAt` timestamp captured **once per dispatch and reused across that dispatch's retries**. This gives distinct occurrences distinct keys while keeping retries of one occurrence stable. Message keys are scoped by `sessionId` because WhatsApp message ids are unique per account, not globally.

### Retries with exponential backoff

When the queue is enabled, a non-2xx response, timeout (`WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`, default `10000` ms), or network error schedules a retry. The number of attempts comes from the webhook's `retryCount` (default `3`) and the delay grows **exponentially** from a base of `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY` (default `5000` ms). Each retry reuses the same `idempotencyKey` and increments `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count`. If Redis/BullMQ rejects the initial enqueue, OpenWA logs a `webhook:error` hook event and falls back to direct delivery with the same inline retry budget. When the queue is disabled, delivery is direct with the same retry budget applied inline.

### SSRF guard on registration

Webhook URLs are validated at **registration time**, not just at delivery. When SSRF protection is enabled (the default), creating or updating a webhook with a URL that resolves to a private/internal/loopback address is rejected synchronously with `400 Bad Request` instead of failing silently later at delivery. The `SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` escape-hatch applies equally to registration and delivery. Independently of the SSRF flag, a URL embedding credentials (`https://user:pass@host/hook`) is rejected with `400` — such credentials would otherwise be persisted and echoed into delivery logs and dead-letter rows. Operator-supplied custom headers that target reserved names (`Content-Type` or any `X-OpenWA-*`) are stripped, so a webhook config cannot forge the signature, event, or idempotency headers.
