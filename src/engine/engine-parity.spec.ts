 *
 * The reverse direction — `not-available` implies throws — is the one that catches a "phantom
 * support" stub: an adapter method that returns null/[] for a capability it cannot deliver, so a
 * caller reads an empty result as an answer instead of the 501 it should get. Those stubs are what
 * docs/29-engine-capability-matrix.md's "0 phantom-support rows" asserts, and until this direction
 * was checked, that claim was true only by inspection — a cell could be marked `not-available`,
 * quietly stop throwing, and nothing would go red.
 *
 * Both directions now trip on any change, forcing a deliberate matrix update.
 *
 * No engine is instantiated and no Chromium/socket is opened: it reads method bodies via
 * `Class.prototype.method.toString()`, a fast hermetic structural check.
