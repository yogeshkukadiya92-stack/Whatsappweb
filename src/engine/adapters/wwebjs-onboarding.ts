 * function means the DOM matching can be unit-tested directly, rather than only through a mocked
 * `evaluate` that proves nothing about the matching itself.
 *
 * The BUTTON is the presence signal, never the heading text on its own. `textContent` on a `div`
 * concatenates every descendant, so a chat-list row previewing the words "what's new" — an ordinary
 * English message — satisfies a heading-only test. Treating that as a stuck modal would take a
 * perfectly healthy session out of READY and block every send. A visible control whose exact label is
 * the confirm label, sitting within a few levels of an element that also carries the heading, is a
 * shape the chat list does not produce. The ancestor walk is bounded for the same reason: matching
 * against `<body>` would just be the loose text test again.
 *
 * LANGUAGE. The default label and the heading are English, and the modal is rendered in whatever
 * language WhatsApp Web decides. Two things address that, both defaulting to today's behaviour:
 * the launch args pin `--lang` so the page has a deterministic locale, and an operator can add
 * their own labels (see {@link resolveOnboardingContinueLabels}). An operator-supplied label matches
 * WITHOUT the heading check — the English heading would reject a localised modal regardless, so
 * requiring both would make the setting inert. The default `Continue` keeps the heading requirement,
 * so the out-of-the-box false-positive surface is unchanged.
