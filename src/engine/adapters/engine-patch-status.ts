/**
 * Startup guard for OpenWA's install-time engine patches.
 *
 * The patches are applied two ways, and only one of them is loud. The Docker production stage runs
 * every patcher WITHOUT `--best-effort`, so an unrecognised source shape fails the image build. A
 * source install runs them through `scripts/postinstall.js` WITH `--best-effort`, where a patcher
 * that cannot apply prints one line into a long `npm install` transcript and the install still
 * succeeds. The operator then runs a tree that is missing a fix, and the symptom arrives later as
 * exactly the opaque failure the patch existed to remove: an unnamed 500, a send that reports no
 * message, a resync loop that never ends. None of those errors name their cause.
 *
 * So restate it on the machine that is actually affected, as the engine starts.
 *
 * Ground truth only. Each patcher exports `isApplied()`, which is that patcher's OWN stand-down
 * branch, reading the installed file. There is deliberately no manifest and no recorded install
 * outcome: a record can survive a dependency being reinstalled underneath it, and a guard that
 * says "patched" about an unpatched tree is worse than no guard at all.
 *
 * Diagnostic, not preventive, matching `wwebjs-backport-check.ts`: startup continues, so a session
 * reaching READY is not evidence that every patch landed.
 *
 * `scripts/patch-wwebjs-201832.js` is absent from this by design. It is the one patcher that
 * already has a runtime guard (`wwebjs-backport-check.ts`, its own predicate and its own message),
 * so it exports no `isApplied` and is skipped here rather than being reported twice or migrated in
 * the same change. `engine-patch-status.spec.ts` pins it as the only such exception.
