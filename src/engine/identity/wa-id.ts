/**
 * Engine-neutral WhatsApp identity handling.
 *
 * WhatsApp addresses the same entity through several dialects:
 *   - `<phone>@c.us`           a user, addressed by phone (whatsapp-web.js dialect)
 *   - `<phone>@s.whatsapp.net`  the SAME user, in the raw protocol dialect (Baileys)
 *   - `<lid>@lid`               a user addressed by a privacy id (LID); the number is NOT a phone
 *   - `<id>@g.us`               a group
 *   - `status@broadcast`        the status/stories pseudo-JID
 *   - `<id>@newsletter`         a channel; `<id>@broadcast` a broadcast list
 *   - any of the above may carry a `:<device>` multi-device suffix
 *
 * The engine boundary is an anti-corruption layer: adapters reduce all of that to the NEUTRAL dialect
 * the application layer sees, so app code never has to know which engine produced an id. The neutral
 * dialect is intentionally small:
 *   - `<phone>@c.us`  a user known by phone        (the common case; @s.whatsapp.net folds into this)
 *   - `<id>@g.us`     a group
 *   - `<lid>@lid`     a user known ONLY by privacy id - phone genuinely unknown (a first-class state)
 *   - `status@broadcast` / `<id>@newsletter` / `<id>@broadcast`  special channels
 *   - never `@s.whatsapp.net`, never a `:device` suffix
 *
 * Resolution rule: prefer `@c.us` (resolve a lid to its phone when the mapping is known); fall back to
 * `@lid` only when it can't be resolved. An unresolved lid is NOT pretended to be a phone.

 * (`WAJIDDomains.HOSTED` = 128, `HOSTED_LID` = 129). The user-part is the SAME account either way,
