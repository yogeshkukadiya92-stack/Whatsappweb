/**
 * Aggregate in-flight request-body budget.
 *
 * The per-request body cap (BODY_SIZE_LIMIT, enforced by the body parser) bounds ONE upload but
 * says nothing about how many bodies may be buffered at once: N connections each trickling a
 * near-limit body pin N × limit bytes of memory before any guard ever runs — the Nest throttler /
 * auth guards sit at the routing layer, AFTER middleware and body buffering, so they cannot see
 * slow-body memory pinning. With a 25 MiB per-request cap, a hundred slow senders is enough to
 * push a 2 GiB container out of memory.
 *
 * This middleware closes the gap. It tracks the aggregate body bytes currently in flight across
 * ALL connections — the declared Content-Length where present, one budget slot otherwise — and
 * refuses NEW requests with 503 + Retry-After once the budget is exhausted, without reading a
 * single byte of the rejected body.
 *
 * The bound is on WIRE bytes, and it holds as heap only while a body is stored as it arrives.
 * A compressed body would break that — admitted at its compressed length, then inflated by the
 * parser into memory nothing accounted for — so a non-identity Content-Encoding is refused with
 * 415 outright rather than priced. The remaining looseness in the wire-byte ACCOUNTING is
 * deliberate and bounded: a chunked identity body reserves a placeholder and is reconciled against
 * socket.bytesRead on the poll interval, so it can briefly under-report by the bytes that arrive
 * within one interval. Separately, and by design, an admitted identity body still costs a constant
 * multiple of its wire size once parsed (the raw Buffer pinned on rawBody, plus the decoded string
 * and the parsed object) — the budget bounds the input, not the parse.
 *
 * A stalled sender (headers, then silence) holds its
 * reservation only until the stall reaper drops the socket after STALL_TIMEOUT_MS without any
 * new body bytes, so a handful of silent connections cannot pin the whole budget. The request
 * stream itself is never tapped — no 'data' listener — so downstream consumers (the body
 * parser, busboy) see every chunk exactly as it arrives, even when they attach late.
 *
 * Extracted from main.ts so the accounting — notably the exactly-once release across every
 * terminal path — is unit-tested without booting the app.
