/**
 * Migration-chain vs entity-metadata drift gate.
 *
 * `migration:generate` diffs the entity metadata against a DataSource whose schema the migration
 * chain built. When the two drift, generate produces a spurious multi-table rebuild (the sqlite
 * column-type dialect split documented in CreateStatusUpdates' header) instead of a delta, so the
 * documented generate workflow becomes unusable and real drift hides inside the noise. Nothing
 * gated this: synchronize-built (dev/e2e) and chain-built (production) schemas could diverge
 * with every other test green, because nothing built the schema BOTH ways and compared.
 *
 * Each connection builds its FULL chain on an in-memory SQLite DataSource, then asks TypeORM's
 * schema builder what it would change to match the entity metadata (captured inside a transaction
 * that is rolled back, so nothing persists). The result is compared against a pinned snapshot of
 * the drift the chain carries TODAY. This is the same harness the from-scratch boot e2e drives
 * (test/sqlite-chain-boot).

/**
 * The drift the chain carries today, pinned VERBATIM rather than classified by statement shape.
 *
 * Shape classification cannot work here. On SQLite the schema builder resolves a column change by
 * rebuilding the whole table (CREATE temporary_X + INSERT + DROP + RENAME, plus every index on it),
 * and it emits a bare CREATE INDEX for a new index. Those are the same statement shapes the KNOWN
 * drift produces, so any filter broad enough to pass the known set also passes a new column and a
 * new index: exactly the drift this gate exists to catch. Comparing the full statement text does
 * not have that blind spot, because a new column changes the CREATE TABLE body and a new index adds
 * a statement that is not in the snapshot.
 *
 * The known drift itself is cosmetic: the baseline migration created dated columns as 'datetime'
 * while the entities declare dateColumnType() = 'text' on SQLite (both TEXT affinity, so the data is
 * identical), plus index-NAME differences where TypeORM's auto-generated hash names differ from the
 * migration-declared ones. A normalizing migration at the chain tail closes it.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS: read the diff before touching the snapshot. Statements listed as unexpected are
 * schema your entities declare and your migrations do not create, which is a real bug that reaches
 * production (a synchronize-disabled deploy answers 500 `no such column` on the first query that
 * touches it). Regenerate the snapshot only when you have deliberately changed the known drift, for
 * example by landing a normalizing migration, and expect the count to go DOWN when you do.
