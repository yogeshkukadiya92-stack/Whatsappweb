/**
 * One reconciliation pass over a storage prefix: delete files no row references, but only after the
 * sweep has seen them unreferenced for at least the grace window. Shared by the stores that keep
 * media blobs alongside DB rows (status store, chat-media archive) and share one bucket — each
 * caller scopes itself to its own prefix and never touches the other's files.
 *
 * First-seen is tracked in the caller-owned `firstSeenAt` map (epoch ms per unreferenced key), so a
 * restart simply restarts the grace clock (fails safe) and a file mid-write is never reaped. The map
 * is pruned to the keys still orphaned at the end of the pass, so it cannot grow unbounded.
 *
 * Files are enumerated with iterateFiles(), NOT listFiles(): listFiles() truncates at
 * STORAGE_LIST_MAX_FILES (a per-call DoS guard, not a completeness contract), which would strand
 * every orphan past the cap.
 *
 * Returns the number of files deleted. The summary log stays with the caller (each sweep reports in
 * its own wording); a failed delete is reported through `onDeleteFailed` and retried on a later pass.
