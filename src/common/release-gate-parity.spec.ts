/**
 * The release workflow publishes the image and the GitHub Release from a tag push. A tag starts
 * release.yml ALONE (ci.yml triggers on branches), so whatever gate the tag path skips is a gate a
 * release never ran; the workflow's own header states the invariant ("a tag can never publish
 * something the branch gate would have refused"; "the release gate must not be laxer than the PR
 * gate"). Both sides drifted before: check:contract-shapes and test:docs ran only on branches, so
 * an SDK wire-shape regression or a repo-file drift could ride a tag to publication while the same
 * commit would have failed CI.
 *
 * This locks the invariant structurally: every gate command (npm/npx lines) in ci.yml's lint and
 * test jobs must also run in release.yml's lint and test jobs (the workflow header and the check:audit step comment both state
 * the invariant; this spec makes it enforced). The release jobs may run MORE
 * (its lint also carries the audit gate); only the subset direction is asserted.
