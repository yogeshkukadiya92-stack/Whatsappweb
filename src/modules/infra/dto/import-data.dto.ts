/**
 * Body for POST /infra/import-data, the replace-all restore. A class (not an inline object literal)
 * so the global ValidationPipe's whitelist/forbidNonWhitelisted actually runs — the same reason
 * ImportStorageDto is one. An inline `@Body()` type erases at runtime, so on the most destructive
 * route in the product a body carrying no `tables` reached the handler and failed as a 500 from
 * inside the restore, and a misspelled key was accepted in silence.
 *
 * `tables` is validated as an object and not descended into: without @ValidateNested the fourteen
 * row arrays are leaf values, so whitelist cannot strip them. That is load-bearing, not incidental —
 * every key omitted here is restored EMPTY, so a whitelist that reached inside would silently blank
 * the database it was asked to restore.
 *
 * Both flags only ever OPEN an escape from the orphan-engine refusal, so they are kept strict. Under
 * the pipe's enableImplicitConversion a plain `boolean` property casts every non-empty string —
 * `'false'` among them — to `true` before @IsBoolean() can object, which would open that escape for
 * a caller who spelled the opposite. @ToStrictBoolean accepts only a real boolean or an exact
 * 'true'/'false' and leaves anything else to be refused. An absent flag stays absent, so the default
 * path is still the visible 409 IMPORT_WOULD_ORPHAN_ENGINES.
 *
 * The body IS the export file: `docs/14` tells the operator to post it whole, and the export wraps
 * `tables` in five metadata fields. They are declared with @Allow — accepted, never read — because
 * `forbidNonWhitelisted` rejects any property the class does not name, and rejecting the product's
 * own backup would break the restore this route exists for. They carry no constraints on purpose: a
 * restore must not fail over the shape of a field it ignores, including one written by an older
 * release. `import-data.dto.spec.ts` binds this list to the export contract, so a field added to the
 * export cannot silently start failing the import again.
