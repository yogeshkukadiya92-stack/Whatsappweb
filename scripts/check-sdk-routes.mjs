/**
 * SDK route guard.
 *
 * No gate anywhere compared an SDK to the committed contract. Every SDK suite asserts the URL the
 * SDK itself constructed against a mock transport, so the oracle is circular: rename a route on the
 * server and `openapi:check` fails while all five SDK suites stay green and ship a 404. This closes
 * the cheap half of that gap — every route literal an SDK builds must exist as a path in
 * openapi.json.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated so the guarantee is not read wider than it is:
 *   - Covers JavaScript, PHP and Python, which write their paths as literals a scan can find.
 *   - Does NOT cover Go or Java: both assemble paths by concatenating a base with a suffix, so there
 *     is no literal to harvest. A drift there is invisible to this gate.
 *   - Checks that a route EXISTS, not that its method, request shape or response shape match.
 *   - The send-media verbs are harvested separately (see SEND_MEDIA_VERBS below): each SDK passes
 *     the verb as a plain string to a shared builder, so no per-route literal exists to scan.
 *
 * Lives in ci.yml's lint job rather than sdk-ci.yml on purpose: sdk-ci is path-filtered and does not
 * list openapi.json, so changing the contract alone runs none of it — and it never runs on a release
 * tag at all.
 *
 * Run locally: `npm run check:sdk-routes`.
