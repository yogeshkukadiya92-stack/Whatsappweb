/**
 * Make whatsapp-web.js report which requested participants it actually acted on.
 *
 * `GroupChat.removeParticipants` / `promoteParticipants` / `demoteParticipants` resolve every
 * requested id against the group's OWN participant collection and silently drop what they cannot
 * find (`.filter(Boolean)`), then hand the survivors to a WA Web request builder and resolve
 * `{status: 200}` for the whole batch. Two failures follow, both reproduced live (#1220):
 *
 * 1. When EVERY requested id is dropped the builder receives an empty repeated field and asserts
 *    "expected at least 1 children, but found 0". The page rejects, and because the adapter only
 *    inspects a RESOLVED value the error escapes as an unnamed `500`.
 * 2. When only SOME are dropped — or, for promote/demote, when all are — the call still resolves
 *    `{status: 200}` with no indication of what was ignored, so the adapter reports success for
 *    people WhatsApp never touched. Promote and demote have no arity assertion at all, which makes
 *    their version of this silent rather than loud.
 *
 * One transform per page function, each its own group so an upstream change to one does not disable
 * the other two:
 *  - keep the resolved array WITH its holes, so position still maps to the requested id;
 *  - derive `matched` (a boolean per requested id) and `present` (the survivors);
 *  - call the WA Web action only when something survived — an empty batch is not a request;
 *  - return `matched` alongside the status. The adapter treats a missing or wrong-length `matched`
 *    as "unpatched tree" and keeps its old behaviour, matching the `eventsAttached` marker
 *    convention in patch-wwebjs-ready-sync.js.
 *
 * The source transform is deliberately exact and self-disabling: an unknown shape fails the build
 * instead of silently shipping without the fix, matching the sibling patchers. The file is written
 * once, after the whole group set resolves.
