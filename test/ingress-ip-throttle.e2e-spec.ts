/**
 * The ingress route is `@Public` and carries `@SkipThrottle()` so the global per-IP tiers leave it
 * alone (their 100/min sits below the per-instance 120/min and would 429 a shared-egress provider
 * before the instance bound ever fired). That left the per-instance bucket as the only limiter, and
 * its key is built from the caller-supplied `:pluginId/:instanceId` path segments, so walking those
 * segments minted a fresh bucket per request: an unauthenticated client had no effective bound at
 * all. This proves the client-keyed tier now binds regardless of the path.
 *
 * The pairs below name no registered instance, so each request 404s at the handler. That is the
 * point: the guard runs BEFORE the handler, so a 404 still consumes budget, and an unknown-instance
 * flood is exactly the shape that had no limit.
